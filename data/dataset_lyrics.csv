You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it

You're paralyzed

From the beast about to strike

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)

You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht
And really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey, one little thing I really need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex
And checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Hurry down the chimney tonight

Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon, the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Okay, my daddy was a gangstеr, what the fuck that made me?
Niggas claiming that it's love dawg but it can't be
Know I fell in love with guns by the age of thirteen
And my pocket rocket on me, homie don't reach

तुम्हें वहाँ पहुँचाने के लिए जो कुछ भी करो, मैं तुम्हें एक लेयर पर रखूँगा, हाँ

Brodie want her friends, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bro, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we're the who's who's?
Still run around with mohawk, Jet ready, pack the Goyard
People think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is ""Baby, keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick divided
Bro ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be knowin' the rundown, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come check, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full court press, foot on they neck and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat and tears come with these checks and it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gone get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' playdoh

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

Overbuyin' cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'm gonna pull up and spray that
Livin' like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like yo mama with the switch ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bro taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill, I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years

Ah, ah, ah, ay

What doesn't help, don't let it get in the way
You made an own goal for being clumsy
The torque turned out to be too big for you
I'm not for you to fall in love with anymore, baby (Chi)
Without a Visa or passport
I sent your fake love on a vacation (Chi, chi, chi, chi, chi, chi)
Fuck off and don't come back
I hope you get everything you deserve, no
For what you did to me if you don't remember

Don't call me again, I threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes
Don't misunderstand me
Bеcause of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again (Chi)

I got to the party, takе the bottle out
The one that loved you, I don't know who she is
I left you a review, I didn't give you even one star
And I forgot you because you didn't leave footprints
I don't look back anymore, not even to park
I have one that's ready to take me
The second is waiting in the hotel
And the third, I'll meet him tonight (No, no)
Don't call me, 'cause I changed my number (Changed)
If you want me to give it you (Give)
Call 1-800-go fuck yourself

You're desire to come back (Ayy) died in the attempt (Ah)
You made it look like you lost time
You came out well because I don't even count mine (Papi)
I see you on social media, I can't believe it, what a shame (What a shame)
I was good and you such trash paying me back like that (Wow, such trash)
Rat with two feet, Paquita said it
A creeping animal (Haha)
That eats everything he finds
Damn, you're a whore (Whore)
Don't say ""I adore you"", instead be honest (Ayy)
Don't say ""I love you"" (Ah) because that was in vain (Ah)
You were crying and since I didn't get with you
You're eating another, but you're thinking of me (Chi)

Sturdiana, buss a move when I get up behind ya

I do what I do and she do what she wanna
That's a fact and no cap
Me and Sheff had to run up them racks
If you miss then we doublin' back

Fell in love and I got too attached

If we up it, ain't no comin' back
Fuck with my opps, said they no comin' back
Is you with it?, If you up it, I up it, let's get it

Sometimes I get impatient
Mask on, no face no, cases, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fall back, baby I gotta breathe
Fear nobody, I'm ready to bleed
And she for the streets, she not for me
From a place where they never believe
In the hood, thought I never would leave
Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knock as he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive
You seen what I seen then you'd probably agree
Cops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief
And mama told me not to play in these streets

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

Fuck everything that you say about me

But one thing they don't do is play about me

I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper

I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)

From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out

But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around

I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

{Inaudible Chatter}

[Verse 1]
Ohh!
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Verse 2]
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'

And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
[Bridge 1]
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again

[Bridge 2]
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along

Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever (Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed (Burn the world your last endeavor)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here

And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare

While your nightmare comes to life

Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason (Loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear

Fight (Fight!), not to fail (Fail!), not to fall (Fall!)
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (Die!), die again (Die!), drenched in sin (Sin!)
With no respect for another, oh!
Down (Down!), feel the fire (Fire!), feel the hate (Hate!)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!), hit the wall (Wall!), watch you crawl (Crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul, and it's ours now to steal

Go DJ, that's my DJ
I'm a Miami Boy, you know how we play
I ain't playing with you, but I wanna play with you
Give me, got me good, now watch me
It's a different species, get me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn
Tiger Woods times Jesse James
Equals Pitbull all night long
Pick up Barack and Michelle and let them know that it's on
Pa' fuera, pa' la calle
Dale mamita, tirame ese baile
Dale mamita, tirame ese baile
I see you watching me, you see me watching you
I love the way you move, I like them things you do, like

Don't stop, baby, don't stop, baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop, baby, won't stop, baby
Until you get enough

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Bütün dünyaya söylədim, bir gün borcumu geri ödəcəyəm
Bunu kasetdə saxladım, bir gün kaseti yenidən oxuda bilim
Amma bunu söyləyərkən mən belə inanmırdım
Şübhə getdikcə yaxınlaşır
Hər günüm ya qara, ya da boz
Ümid, mənə sadəcə bir zərrəsi lazım
Çünki, kimsə mənim gördüyümü görmür
Musiqimlə söyləməyə çalışdığımda bərbad deyirlər
Onlar mükəmməlin nə olduğunu bilmirlər
Bunu yazarkən ayıq olub-olmadığımı belə bilmirəm
Tək bildiyim şey bu pis günlərimdə yanımda olmağının zərurəti
Mənə dayaq oldun, yeni bir həyat verdin
Bütün bunları sənə borcluyam
Amma niyə mənim gördüyüm kimi görə bilmədiyini anlamıram
Bu içimdən gəldi, sən oğlunu itirdin
İblislər səninlə vuruşur, hər yer qaranlıq
İzn ver işıqları yandırıb hər yeri aydınladım və nə olduğunu görməyinə şərait yaradım
Mənim üçün nə ifadə etdiyini bildiyini sanmıram, həm də heç
Çünki, səninlə mən bir komanda kimi idik, sənin köməkçin idim
Bu lənətə gəlmiş mikrofonu buraxdıqda mənimlə savaşmaq istəyəcəksən
Ya da məni qucaqlayacaqsan, amma seçimlərim çox az
Edə biləcəyim bir şey yoxdur, çünki..

Ağlımı itirmək üzrəyəm
Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Sənin çırpındığını gördükcə üzülürəm; mənə yeni fikirlərlə gəlirsən
""Onlar sadəcə piyada"" deyirsən, başa düşmürəm
Çünki, eşitdiklərim çox mənasız
Amma ya getdikcə tənbəlləşirsən
Ya da artıq özünə inancın qalmadı
Öz fikirlərini belə canlandıra bilmirsən, elə görünür
Qərar verə bilmirsən, özünü günahlandırırsan
Və hardasa mənim köməyim üçün yalvarırsan da
Sanki mən sənin liderinəmmiş kimi, mənim ağıl müəllimim olmalı idin
Artıq dayana bilmirəm, kim olduğunu xatırla
Mənə inanan sən idin
Halbuki hər kəs məni götürməməli olduğunu söylərkən
Şirkətindəki hər kəs, gəl həqiqətlərdən danışaq
Kariyeranı mənim üçün riskə atan sən idin, bunu ikimiz də bilirik
Kimsə ağ birisi ilə əlləşmək istəmədi
Dre, bu kabinetdə ağlayıram
Həyatımı xilas etdin, indi isə xilas etməsi sırası məndə
Amma sənə əsla borcumu ödəyə bilmərəm, etdiklərin hər şeydən önəmli
Amma inanmaqdan əl çəkmirəm, sən də məndən
Oyan Dre, ölürəm, sənə ehtiyacım var, Tanrı xatirinə geri dön!

Ağlımı itirmək üzrəyəm
Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Ciddən bir ömür öncəymiş kimi hiss edirəm
Yenə də xatırlayıram sanki dünən baş verib
Sarı paltarınla gəldin, içəridəki hər kəs lağa qoydu
Sən studioya girənə kimi, mikfrofonu öldür demişdim
Dostlarım oldu, bəziləriylə yola getdik
Amma hamısı getdi, ölənə kimi dost qalacağımızı söyləmişdilər
Bəs indi hansı cəhənnəmdədirlər?
Tam onlara ehtiyacım varkən heç birini görə bilmirəm; tək gördüyüm Slim
Hamınız rədd olun! Yalnız ona ehtiyacım var
Lənətə gəlmiş xainlər
Çətin vəziyyətə düşdüyümüzdə sadəcə izləyib güldünüz
İndi isə Aftermath'ın qəzəbini görəcəksiniz, ibnələr!
Bizi yalnızca işləyərkən görəcəksiniz
Və ""Harada idiniz"" deyə soruşacaqsınız
Götümün qərarsız yanaqlarını öpün, qurdlar, Eminem'iminkiləri də
Pox kimi beatlər və riyaziyyat
Gic prodüsserlər; Mən geri döndüm, piçlər!
Son bir CD daha və sonrasında əşyalarımı toplayıram
Və ayrılarkən də qaranti verirəm ki, qışqıracaqsınız
""Dre, bizi belə qoyma dostum"" çünki..

[Verse 1]
It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you and, boy, she's bringin' you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

She is half your age
But I'm guessin' that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missin' me
You've been tellin' people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me and, boy, you're bringin' me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core

Without falling to your feet

Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

They're burning, I'd rather be numb (I'd rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

Well… Lil Wayne has a new single, and it’s called “Love Me”. Well, with a title like that, I don’t know what to expect. However, after “How to Love” turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life, maybe a song titled “Love Me” would be a more personal number. Contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships. And yeah, it could just be another crappy bragging song, but I like to be optimistic when I go into a review. So... what? That’s not the full title of the song? What’s the full title of the song?
Drake: Bitches love me
Man, I feel stupid. Well, let’s get this over with
Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
-stupid, unnecessary audio watermark for the producer-
*sneers*
I don’t know what I was doing-
Wait. What was that thing she’s wearing? Is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle? A mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much? Wow, we’ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory, haven’t we? I mean… you know what, I haven’t even started talking about the lyrics yet. I’m just gonna let this one go
Okay, so this song, which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit, is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex. And…maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff! Like, you know, headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now. Or swing sets. Yeah…
Future: Imma ball ‘til the day I fall
One more thing before we continue. When did this Future character here, a guy who barely passes as a rapper, let alone a singer, become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy? I mean, according to what I’m seeing on the lyric sheet, he has no verse! So without his own full verse, the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook. And I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but…
(shows a cover of the single for “Loveeee Song” by Future and Rihanna as that song plays)
Future isn’t exactly a powerhouse vocalist. I mean, could Lil Wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks? Aren’t you still friends with T-Pain? At least that guy has some personality, this guy is… huh. Funny that a guy named Future is relying on a vocal effect that’s near extinction. I mean, when even T-Pain says...
T-Pain: Auto tune is on its way out!
Back in 2008, I think it’s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously. But back to the song
Drake: Long as my bitches love, my bitches love
Wait, now Drake is on the chorus? Is this the Drake and Future collaboration the world was waiting for? He doesn’t have a verse either, so I can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting. But forgive me again, we need to get back to the song
Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
So the song is about how he doesn’t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him. Which is typical, but for some reason, in this song he’s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky, confident braggadocio. Actually listen to the song without the arrogant, too cool to care faces in the music video. And really listen to their voices:
Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
Is there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess? I mean, if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is, that would be perfect, but it’s not. And usually, failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that’s full of vigor and 808, but he can’t do that here, since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that’s present on nearly every friggin’ song featuring Drake, and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens, their lifeless delivery stops the song dead!
Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
Does he actually sound convinced here? Does he legitimately sound like he doesn’t care about haters? I don’t know about you guys, but to me it sounds like he’s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve. All I hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess! And we haven’t even gotten to the verses yet!
Lil Wayne: Pussy ass niggas, stop hating
So, you don’t care about haters in any way, shape or form, and only care about your women... but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters. Because you know, what better way to show that you don’t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them?
(montage of Wayne mentioning haters throughout the song)
I don’t know about you, but there’s something slightly contradictory about shouting, “HEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!”
Lil Wayne: Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man!
D-do hoes like Satan? I mean, I know hoes are known for having questionable morality, but I don’t think anyone actively likes Satan. I don’t even think Satanists likes Satan, they just do it to piss off Christians. I mean I know you’re trying to relate the Satan and fire thing, but hoes don’t like fire either!
Lil Wayne: And these hoes love me like Satan, man!
You know, believe it or not, but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that Lil Wayne is part of some demonic cult. And honestly, if you think some post-production CGI inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think Lil Wayne works for the devil... then he does work for the devil... and he’s going to kill you
Lil Wayne: Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she’s on a strict diet
You don’t know how segways work, do you? I mean, what thought process takes you from “I’m going to kill you!” to “This chick is all about my penis.” For real! The only piece of transitional material we get is the word “and”. And I don’t know about you, but linking two phrases together with the word “and” is not the same as a transitional phrase, and I like nipples
Lil Wayne: She don’t want money
She wants the time we could spend
Pfft. Yeah, okay. Lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you!
Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
Okay… I’m, I’m trying to explain what’s wrong with these lines, and what disturbs me about them. Because it’s not just about the fact that they’re objectifying the girl in question. No, that’s to be expected with Wayne. But it’s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that. And I just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question:
Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
In what way does this NOT sound like an abusive relationship? In what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who’s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her? I mean it’s not overtly stating it, but it’s definitely implied. (sees a shot of a woman in the scolds bridle) Wow. That is not helping. But anyway, in his episode of Behind the Music, he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him, and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that. If this is true, it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself. And you know what? He’s an artist, and an artist telling you about his perspective doesn't always have to be a positive thing
But my problem lies not in his questionable morals…well actually yes it does, but it’s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular, plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls! I mean, he’s making no bones about the fact that he doesn’t respect you, so at this point, if you’re still trying to get with him, your motivations are probably no better than his, and I think you know what I mean when I talk about the motivations of these types of women. You know, those women, always wanting to spend all of your time…
Lil Wayne: She wants the time we could spend
*scoff* Heartless succubus. But hey, maybe he’s not that bad. Maybe when he’s with these women, he’s actually respectful of the... I’m sorry, are there women in cages like circus animals? So…let me get this straight. Lupe Fiasco makes a song that barely charts, talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects, and should hold themselves to a higher standard, and he’s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff. But Lil Wayne has a top 10 hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages?! With lines like...
Lil Wayne: I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
And… nobody’s making a stink about this! I’m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything, I just think it’s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on, while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay. But where was I? Oh, yes. So like I was saying, I’m sure in real life, Wayne is very respectful to women…
Lil Wayne: These hoes got pussies like craters
Damn! That…that imagery! Again, to all the women still wanting to have sex with Lil Wayne: THIS is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas! *picture of a crater* So…I think he’s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you’re all whores!
Lil Wayne: Can’t treat these hoes like ladies, man!
Hey…who do you treat like a lady? Because by acknowledging the idea of lady, you’re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status. But none of the girls you’ve ever met have achieved that status in your head. So it’s not that you’re saying that all women are whores; you’re just saying that all women you refer to are whores. Hmm... I wonder how that works for other things
""I’m not saying that all Chinese people are good at math, play piano and know Kung Fu, I’m just saying that all the Chinese people I’m ever going to refer to are good at math, play piano and know Kung-where’s everybody going?""
Lil Wayne: Pussy, money, weed, codeine
Was that a lyric, or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to?
Lil Wayne: She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed: 69, 96
Wait. What do those last numbers have to do with anything? Are you saying that you and her are 69’ing each other? Well that doesn’t work, since you only mention that she’s going down on you! And what is 96 supposed to mean?! Do you know why it’s called 69, Wayne? Because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other. So what is 96 supposed to represent? Two people…facing away from each other? What, are they lying on each other’s butts? That makes no sense!
Lil Wayne: I feel her heartbeat
It’s a little late to get romantic, don’t you think?
Lil Wayne: I chest to chest with this bitch
Yeah, I thought so
Lil Wayne: Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it’s like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
Hold on a minute, maybe the song’s trying to say something. Maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn’t actually lead to a fulfilling life. And maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet! Of course there’s no real revelation, he just continues to talk about haters and hoes
Lil Wayne: Now kiss my ass if you hatin
I’m getting ass or I’m skating
Anything that keeps you from playing the guitar. *shows a scene of Wayne playing the guitar live* Yeah, keep hitting those two notes, buddy. I’m sure the people who play the Beginner mode on Guitar Hero are impressed
Yeah, overall, this gets a 0 out of 5 from me. The melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song, which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it. And the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat! And his rhymes are terrible. There’s no wordplay here that’s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist. It crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance. And ultimately, does not make for a good listening experience
And that’s pretty much all I have to say about that. Well, I’m the Rap Critic. You don’t have to like my opinion, but I don’t have to like your song

I don’t know about you, but there’s something slightly contradictory about saying, “HEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!” (Someone in the distance: OKAY!"") *chuckles*",0.32328555894155914

He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I-I-I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want (Oh-oh)

Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Alright)
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Uh)

She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her, ""Make me some money"", she tell me, ""Make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"", she say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on somethin' tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long

And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""",0.6963376286439598

Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty

Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely

Out in Paris, I learned what real ice is
Hee-shee, I'm kickin' flava' in your ear

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""

I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

I pulled you closer to my chest

I think that you should get some rest""

I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

For a minute, I'll forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

Schöner kleiner Körper, tanzt wie Gogo, hey

Ich muss dafür sorgen, dass du alleine bist (oeh)
Warum nicht? Eine verdammt gute Zeit hat noch niemanden geschadet
Ich hab einen kleinen Drink, aber es nicht Barcadi
Wenn du das Mädchen liebtest, tut es mir sehr, sehr leid
Ich muss es ihr geben als wären wir in einer Ehe
Oh, als wären wir in Eile
Nein, nein, ich werde es niemanden erzählen
Du bist auch auf deinem Level
Versuchen zu machen, was Liebhaber tun

Fühle mich als wäre ich frisch raus; Boosie
Wenn sie das Drama wollen, hab ich die Uzi
Schiffe die ganze Crew zum Kreuzfahrtschiff
Machen Scheiße, die du nicht mal in Filmen siehst
Fahr mit mir, fahr mit mir, Boss
Ich hab einen harten Kopf, aber ihr Arsch ist weich
Sie will den Nachnamen mit dem Ring darauf
Weil ich holte eine Millionen raus, sagte ihr, sie soll drauf planken

Und du bist unvergessbar
Ich muss dafür sorgen, dass du alleine bist
Jetzt willst du dir aussuchen
Lass den Champagner im 'Cuzi einfach spritzen

Es ist nicht gut genug für mich
Seitdem ich mit dir gewesen bin, ooh
Es wird nicht mit dir funktionieren
Niemand kann mich gleich machen (Ich weiß)
Ich werde an diesem Drink nippen, wenn ich im Arsch bin
Ich sollte wissen wie man aufgabelt
Ich werde den Rhythmus bekommen
Während sie gegen mich drückt, ooh, ist sie angeschwipst?

I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet paper
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real, I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, ""Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!""
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it

While I'm wasted with someone else?”

Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning

Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit

You keep in contact with certain exes

Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo

But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed

Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though

Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget

Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up

Ne yapardım ?

Chris Brown'ın vücudunda uyandım (oh yeah)
Bir şekilde bu iş Freaky Friday'e döndü
Bir seçeneğimiz yok ama bu işi tersine döndürmeliyiz
(Oh evet,Oh evet)
Bunun Freaky Friday olduğuna inanamıyorum
Evet,bu Freaky Friday
Chris Brown'ın vücudundayım
Yumuşak penisime zevkle baktım ve bu benim hayal ettiğim penis

Eğer Lil Dicky olarak vücudumda olsaydım, nerde olurdum?
Kendimi bulmaya çalışıyorum içgözlemci bir keşiş gibi
C: Sahada top oynuyorum, aman Tanrım smaç basabiliyorum
C: Şeyimin fotoğrafını snapledim
Penisim Twitter'da trend olmuş? Siktir
Şimdi Klubtayım, kendi yolumdan konuşarak içeri girdim
VIP'ye baktım, tanrım işte oradayım
Ona sinyal çaktım beni içeri alsın diye ama yapmadı
C: Bu lavuk kim bilmiyorum
Ne,kendini ne sanıyor bu?
Cam şişe aldım, korumanın kafasına indirdim (woo)
O piçe doğru yürüdüm
C: Bekle,biraz şunu bir düşün
C: Eğer bana zarar verirsen kendine vermiş olursun
Ama bekle,ben kendimi seviyorum
C: İşte bu anahtar kelime,şimdi geriye dönüyoruz

Chris Brown'ın vücudunda uyandım (evet)
Bir şekilde bu iş Freaky Friday'e döndü
Bir seçeneğimiz yok ama bu işi tersine döndürmeliyiz

Dime que me vas a hacer
El enfrentamiento no es na' nuevo para mí
Puedes traer una bala, traer una espada, traer un morgue
Pero no puedes traerme la verdad
Al carajo tú y todas tus expectativas
No quiero ni tus felicidades
Reconozco tu falsa confianza
Y promesas calculadas en tu conversación
Odio a la gente que se siente titulada
Mirándome demente porque no te invité
Vaya, ¿Eres importante?
¿Eres la moral de la historia? ¿Estás respaldando?
Pendejo, ni siquiera me gustas
Corrompido el corazón del hombre con un regalo
Así es como descubres con quién estás negociando
Un pequeño porcentaje es con quien estoy construyendo
Quiero el crédito si estoy perdiendo o estoy ganando
Lo juro por mi madre, esa es la mierda más honesta

Solo lloro sin motivo
Solo rezo sin motivo
Solo pienso por la vida, por los días
Por las horas y otra como respirando

Lo dejarías todo si se sintió mal

I don’'t know how or when (Eh, eh)
But I only know that I remembered (Eh, eh)
How I did it to you that time (Oh, oh)
And I can't continue to be alone (Hehe)
But I know that I threw you out
I threw you out of my life, and threw you out (Yeh)

I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go
To hell I sent you … and I sent you
I threw you out of my life, and threw you out
Yeh, yeh, mami

Baby life is a cycle (Wuh)
And if doesn't work, I don't recycle
So move from my life
If I give it to you it’'s to remember a TBT, yeh
I got tired of your liеs
There’'s another girl who likеs me (Yeh)
Everything has its end, everything expires (Yeh)
You’'re the past and the past never returns
Go to hell (Wuh)
My body doesn’'t need you
What it's asking for is a dirty dance in the Placita
I don’'t think our story will repeat
Go ahead, turn on a phillie and leave one ready for now, yeh eh
I hate to know that I trusted in you again
I hate all the ""I Love You's"" that I texted a thousand times
Baby, better than you I have like 10
Our love drove in a Bugatti and you stayed on foot, I threw you out

I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go
To hell you left … and you left
And I nailed your friend, I nailed her
Fuck you, bitch (Wuh)

Baby I threw you out
And ever since I threw you out, the girls come in three's (That's right)
If you don't believe me, just ask (Baby)
That I no longer have stress
To complete the line, they're express
What a mess how your world went backwards
I messed with her
That I fell in love the day I tasted her
I don't think I'm going back and giving it to you
Mami, because I cancelled your service
If I do not answer
The problem is going to hit rock bottom
Mami breathe deeply, while I hide it (That's right)
With you I'm obligated to wear a condom today
But I'm posting in mid-court, baby, like Rondo
I give you a funeral (That's right)
I know that over time the wound heals (By law)
But the truth is that you’'re not at my level
I sweat to God even though you shouldn't swear to God (Ratatata)

Baby I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go (I cut you slack and I let you go, so you know)
To hell I sent you, eh, eh (Are you understanding what we're trying to say? To hell I sent you)
I got you out of my life, eh, eh

To hell, I threw you out (Woo)
I feel good without you (Ah)
I no longer suffer for love, now I break hearts, and I have lots of $100 rolls ($100 rolls)
You broke my heart (You broke my heart) (Woo)
Without meaning and without reason (Without meaning and without reason) (Ah)
But I have a new ass who gives me a lot of affection and fucks me real good (Real good)
I'm not going to deny that I suffered and had it bad
But I survived and out of my life I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … (I let you go)
And I don't want to know about you
And to hell I sent you … I'm going to go drink today (Going to do drink)

Out of my life, I threw you out
And I know you're not just anybody
I’'ll spend my entire life
Asking where did it go
But your friend texts me
Every time she desires me
She takes a photo with me
And tells me it's for you to see it
I light up to see if I forget
Your name, your kisses, your body, your moans
We would do it in the car, you would scream in my ear
You left far from here without an explanation
You saw my movie and gave me your back
Now you want to know what I think of you
I feel good because you're not here
The same way you came, you can leave (You can leave)
I’'m not going to deny that I suffered and had it bad
But I survived and out of my life I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … (I let you go)
To hell I sent you …I sent you
I got you out of my life …I got you out
Baby, I threw you out

I'm lying if I tell you that I don't miss it when you would rub your skin on me
I'm lying if I tell you that I don't miss your morning calls
Asking me to give it to you rough in bed and make you my woman
I’'m taking advantage of this remix with Ozu to send you to hell also
I don't want lies or your fakeness
I'm going to the street, to a party tonight
I'll drink two drinks and I'm going to forget you
I'm leaving with the girls who want to play
I don't want lies or your fakeness
I'm going to the street, to a party tonight
I'll drink two drinks and I'm going to forget you
I’m leaving with the girls who want to play

Baby I threw you out …threw you out
I cut you slack and let you go …I let you go

Wondering why she obsessed with me (Sexy)

This a hundred bands, no, it's not a scam
This is Marni Bucket, and, it was made of lamb (Marni)
No, I wasn't lucky, I was in the jam

You tryna tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothang
You can't tell me nothing
Riding on a tractor, lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby, you can go and ask her

Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
Maserati rowdy, got a V12 for my bride (Skrrt)
Foggy rocky road, got a three-wheeler inside (Ayy)
All I wanna do is take a pill, catch a chill vibe
Real prince, I'm really the real don
(I'ma take) I'ma take a horse to the South Berry Road (Ayy)

And I got Franklins all on my mind then chrome the spin (What else)

Bullet proof the ride (Skrrrrrrrrt!)
We spin the block and yell our ""He ain't outside!"" (Where he at)
Heard we had a wedding, he must be the bride (Shit)

Hold up, let me tell y'all something

I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors
[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be
[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

[Chorus]
Yeah, every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

[Verse 4]
All the boats I’ve missed
All the hell I’ve caused
All the lips I’ve kissed
All the love I’ve lost
I thank God for that
I guess he always knew
I was on my way to you

Welcome to the paradise
¡Farru!
Cuatro abrazos y un café
Apenas me desperté
Y al mirarte recordé
Que ya todo lo encontré
Tu mano en mi mano
De todo escapamos
Juntos ver el sol caer
(Let them enjoy the paradise)

Vamos pa' la playa, pa’ curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres busca bullas y me gusta

Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento

Ya, ya, ya, ¡Farru!
Y aprovecha que el sol 'tá caliente y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
Vámono’ a meternos pa'l agua pa' que veas qué rico se siente
Y vámono' en tropical, por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro paramo' a darno' una Medalla
Bien fría, pa' bajar la sequía
Un poco de Bob Marley y unos trago’ ’e sangría
Pa' que te sueltes, poco a poquito
Porque pa’ vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Y dale lento, date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi, vamo' a darle despacito (Ya, ya, ya)
Pa' que te suelte', poco a poquito
Porque pa’ vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico (Laramercy gang)

Farru, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Y darle lento, métele violento
Te puse reggaetón pa' que me apague' ese cuerpo
Métele hasta abajo, está duro ese movimiento
El único testigo que tenemos aquí e' el viento
Y dale, métele cintura, mátame con tu hermosura
Mira cómo me frontea porque sabe que está dura

Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos andando
Calma, mi vida, con calma

I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""

And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming

Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла
Попаду в колоду, будто крупье в казино
Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана ""Мозга"" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...

Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну
Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу
Магический шар
В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер

В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!
Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...

(Cook that shit up, Quay)

[Verse 1]
My mama been told me don't give no poor performance
And whatever you gon' do, just do it
Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contacts full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that Mexican, tryna figure out what my cousin doin'
Prison with the 'migos, found out they was sellin' bricks
Wish I would've knew that shit, I would've been lit
Swear to God, since I was seventeen, I been hood rich
I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York, I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wan' show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lam' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up, but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm buyin' that red Richard Mille
Stay out my lil' brother business, just know that they gettin' millions
[Chorus]

Let me bust you down, ah, yeah, yeah

I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
You see, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me, he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, oh (The boy is mine, oh-oh)

[Bridge: Monica & Brandy]
I can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to

I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:
*show ODB with hair*
You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:
""Fantastic Voyage""
Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood
Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by
And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned
*video starts*
You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:
""You wanna tell me what this is all about""
Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint
*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down
Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!
This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…
Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool.

Do you recall, not long ago
Θυμασαι πριν λιγο καιρο
We would walk on the sidewalk
Εμεις θελαμε να διασχισουμε το πεζοδρομιο
Innocent, remember?
Αθωα θυμασαι?
All we did was care for each other
Το μονο που μας ενοιαζε ηταν να φροντιζουμε ο ενας τον αλλον
But the night was warm
Αλλα  την νυχτα ηταν ζεστα
We were bold and young
Ειμασταν τολμηροι και νεοι
All around the wind blows
Ολα τα επαιρνε ο ανεμος
We would only hold on to let go
Εμεις δεν κρατουσαμε τιποτα μεσα μας ολα τα ξεχνουσαμε

Blow a kiss, fire a gun

What will we do when we get old?
Τι θα κανουμε οταν εμεις γινουμε αρκετα μεγαλοι
Will we walk down the same road?
Εμεις θα διασχιζουμε το ιδιο δρομο?
Will you be there by my side?
Θα εισαι στο πλευρο μου?
Standing strong as the waves roll over
Θα παραμενουμε δυνατοι οπως το κυμα που σκαει
When the nights are long
Οταν οι νυχτες ειναι μεγαλες
Longing for you to come home
Θα λαχταρω να επιστρεψεις στο σπιτι
All around the wind blows
Ολα γυρω μας ειναι σαν τον ανεμο

Εμεις θα μπορουσαμε να τα κρατησουμε μεσα μας ή να τα ξεχασουμε

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
