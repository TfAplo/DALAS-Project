There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

No, I don't want no lames in my section

Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verso 1]
Una lágrima que cae, una sensación que hay que disimular
Porque aunque lo sé, lo sabes
Nunca fui capaz de hablar
Yo sé que fuiste tú, el que te fuiste tú
Y si Madrid se quedó solo, eso lo hiciste tú
Y no me importa si vas a llamarme
Yo quiero besarte, besarte y besarte (Besarte), ey

[Coro]
No sé que pasará en Berlín, si esto va a ser el fin
Pero me jode más tener que esperarte
¿Qué pasará en Berlín si tú no estás aquí?
Tal vez si vuelves, no seré la de antes

Y si Madrid se quedó solo, eso lo hiciste tú
Y no me importa si vas a llamarme
Yo quiero besarte, besarte y besarte (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Besarte y besarte y ahora me jode más tener que esperarte
Besarte y besarte y ahora me jode más tener que olvidarte

[Verso 2]
Dije que amor de lejos, felices los cuatro
Si estás con alguien pienso a cada rato
Y no son celos, ponte en mis zapatos
¿Cómo nos damos besos por un iPhone?
No, sé que no, servirá de nada y lo siento yo
Si te vas a ir, vete, por favor
Que tanta espera está peor

Hey, hey

Bientôt, j'irai au ciel rejoindre Rimkus, le p'tit Lamine
Regarde la vie qu'on mène, on fait ça que pour la famille
On a toujours fait que du sale et nos parents ne font que prier
Pardonne-moi si j'suis pas là, c'est qu'je cours derrière les milliers
J'suis avec Savastano dans un quatre étoiles en Crête
Pas très loin de Malia, elle est chargée sous le maillot
Le nez dans mes affaires, bébé, m'attends pas pour le dîner
Et si c'est trop bizarre, bah, j'disparaîtrais comme Houdini
Vaillant comme Souleymane, vaillant comme Mekness et di-Meh
À deux doigts d'péter l'million, mais ce pédé s'fait désirer
Pour l'instant, j'suis dans le hall, sous doré, j'réfléchis
Qui aura l'sourire en coin d'bouche si je flanche ?
Ceux qui parlent fort sont que des baltringues déguisées
J'ai les chaussures qui piquent, j'arrive vers les Champs-Élysées
On peut t'enlever la vie pour sauver nos réputations
Évitons toutes les tentations, à l'heure qu'il est, j'suis dans l'avion
On tire, laisse-les planter, j'arrive en tête du peloton, j'suis là que pour la plata (J'suis là que pour la plata)
Le lundi et le mardi, le gérant se lève à cinq heures par peur qu'on vienne l'éclater (Par peur qu’on vienne l'éclater)

Y a rien d'facile dans l'argent facile, Zé Pequeno me fascine
.357 Magnum, pas de grappling
Y a la volaille qui rapplique, on s'échappe
Minuit, pété sous champ', demain, j's'rai aux Seychelles
Et pour avoir cette vie-là, j'ai remonté les bretelles
Quand le rêve est trop long, le réveil est brutal
Black Panther, comme la daronne de 2Pac
Les barreaux ou les tropiques, on prendra l'argent d'tout-par
Et de toute façon, c'est nous les bests, en vrai
Dis-leur qu'ils restent tranquilles ou le machin va discuter
Tu veux donner des coups de mains ? Allez, baise ton père
J'ai mon papier, j’ai mon équipe, j'suis pas dans la mendicité

Élève dissipé d’après les dires du prof'
Cinq ans plus tard, son fils me demandera une to-ph'
Cinq-cents milles albums plus tard, ma tête a pas gonflé
Le prochain s’appellera ""Destin"", j'vais tout vous raconter (Et j'dirai que la vérité)

Bientôt, j'irai au ciel rejoindre Rimkus, le p'tit Lamine

So take my hand now, seen me
'Cause you've made me into this man
I promise I'll treasure you girl
You're all that I've needed
Completing my world

You, you're my love, my life, my beginning
And I'm just so stumped I got you

Remembering now
All the times, I've been alone
Shown me the way
Let me hear, let me hold
Right through the door straight to you
You're my love, my life, my beginning
It's you

I will never give up on you girl
Treat you right every night
Made my move, just for you
Wanna do, do this right

To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her

Giving me love when you are down and need another

[Intro]
Yo, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Niggas speak down on my name like I wasn't there for 'em (There for 'em)
Talk about back in the days, this isn't back in the days (Back in the days)
They want me back in my ways, chipped tooth and the fade (Tooth and the fade)

[Verse 1]
Uh, musically I'm on Mars
Walkin' all over the beat, puttin' my feet on the stars
I rock it like Lenny, thinkin' like Jimi the first time he seen a guitar
Standin' in front of where they shot Ahmaud and said we gotta know who we are (Know who we are)
Uh, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Wearin' rare Jordans straight from Air Jordan, this a fair warnin'
Too many young gods beef over nothin'
When you get money, you know that it's comin'
Sayin' they homies, but they ain't a hunnid
We the most hunted, uh
I got my Mets hat on to the back (Back)
Y'all already know where we goin' with the stats (Stats)
Hall of fame only, kings and queens only (Queens only)
They all be grabbin' my style but you know they can't hold me
Yeah, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Y'all still on the ground, you know I've been airborne (I've been airbone)
Studyin' Big, studyin' Nietzsche
You gotta call in a chopper to reach me
Homie, I don't need a jeweler to freeze me
Ice in my veins, I make it look easy
Mentally, I'm in Queens
More money more problems, you gotta be ready for all that it brings
Let 'em say what they say, revenge on my plate, I'm lovin' the taste
They see you shinin', emotions get hard to contain
They just not evolvin' the same (The same)
Me and HB is too rare
I'm movin' all through the snares, sound on billionaire
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm flippin' the page
I'm Prince on the stage, SLAVE on his face
You know what they say, KD the wave
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days  (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
Part II

[Verse 2]
Levels of Tarantino
Curbin' my ego, even though he know
Empty glass of Pinot, cigars and casinos
What they especially praise is the ethos
Stacks on blackjack, movin' my chips
No superstition to make me get rich
I'm with this chick, just one I brought today
In between placin' my bets, we shopped at Cartier
Rose gold I copped her a set
Runway hopped in the jet, flight attendant poppin' Moet
I said I need that Dom, off of respect
We havin' conversations, niggas show me property then
I call my nigga Ant, I told him, ""Yo, I gotta be there""
Salmon shish kebab, in a misty fog, rollin' sticky log
Big dawg affair, no kids involved
Roundtable havin' war council
Press one button, it'll change the world around you
Too rare, nothin' to see here, Cuban over my streetwear
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you just to be fair
It's okay to keep the mystique, I learned that in the street
On me, solo or deep, I'm puttin' on for the G's

Part III
[Verse 3]

We been doin' gangsta shit for a long time
Look inside my mind, see a gold mine
I'm my own cosign, she textin' the old line

밤새 내린 눈은 잠깐만 예뻐
낭만은 개뿔
눈치 없는 차들 땜에 금방 새까매진 거 봐
걷기도 빡세 눈밭보단 갯벌
무릎까지 다 젖은 바지
조금 걷다가 나자빠짐
특별한 날 특별하길
변질됐지 별일 없길
뒹굴뒹굴 뒹굴다 눈덩이만 부었지
어제 만든 눈사람은 멀쩡하려나
아 따가 부러
칼바람에 베여 칭칭

컬러풀은 무슨 풀 하나 안 보여
랩하다 콜록콜록콜록 기침

Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind

I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow""
I fall behind

If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside

現實中對的錯的不要提起
現在你是我女主角演齣戲
你可以說不 但我已經牽你飛

對 我愛你
無人認可這種愛
我悄悄帶你看 無人夜深多精彩
那載滿仁義道德的腦袋
是否都應該要帶點愛

外間很多反對我愛你的聲音
任他怎講只要與你持續熱吻
要放冷槍 要炮轟
我們就更愛
誰又不忿 Yeah-yeah
外間冰封所以我對你才著緊
彈指之間釋放我這狂熱內心
情形如夜色找到街燈
我愛你已開始變成癮
讓我的愛惹起公憤
Hoo-woah-woah
No-woah
Ooh-woah, woah-woah

對 我愛你
其餘甚麼都不愛
我懶理這世界 悠然自得漂出海
這剎那為何讓雙手插袋
用一雙手擁抱更可愛

外間很多反對我愛你的聲音
任他怎講只要與你持續熱吻
要放冷槍 要炮轟
我們就更愛
誰又不忿 Yeah-yeah
外間冰封所以我對你才著緊
彈指之間釋放我這狂熱內心
情形如夜色找到街燈
我愛你已開始變成癮
讓我的愛惹起公憤 Hoah

這一秒宇宙停頓 兩顆心在跳
迷迷糊糊沒有別人 自在逍遙
Oh-woah
談及愛 如理性出發
會被蠶食掉

外間很多反對我愛你的聲音
任他怎講只要與你持續熱吻
要放冷槍 要炮轟
我們就更愛
誰又不忿 Ha-ha
或者嘴巴不信我對你肯犧牲
眼睛可不可看看我何其認真
神如何做出這種吸引

Breaking boulders with the tension in the air
And I know we needed to talk about it
But I said talk and all I hear is shouting
Dust collecting on our social skills

Five long years of relentless faking
And I know you need an outlet
And I know you need a friend
But I don’t have the qualifications to be your therapist
And you’ve told me that you’re tired
Believe me, I am too
But I don’t wanna lose my sanity just to not lose you

But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too

Yeah
I sometimes wonder, ""What would I do in the next generation?""
In 1940, if I was enlisted to fight for the nation, or
In 1960, if I had to fight for the rights of my people
And lay down my life on the line so my grandkids could live a life that's peaceful
Would I be on that? Would I be frontline? That's what I'm thinkin'
If I was alive in the 1912 on the Titanic and it was sinkin'
Who am I savin'? Am I fightin' women and children, or am I waitin'?
I wonder, ""What would I do in the next generation?""
Battle of Karbala, if they capturеd me for the sake of my fathеr
Would I stand on my honour like Hussein did and then tell them to make me a martyr?
Would I read, get smarter? Forgive my oppressor, stick to the creed?
If I got locked inside like Nelson Mandela, but never was free
I see a white man dance to rumba, ain't study Patrice Lumumba
But get on the stage and sing like sungba, lajaja-ja-ja, sungba
Fuck it, I wonder, ""What would I do in the next generation?""
Would I fight for justice? Is it the reason my mum named me David?
How can you be king, how can you be king, don't speak for the people?
Them man try draw me out and compare like me and these niggas are equal
I'm a Black man and this bozo sayin' my music socially conscious
While the mandem troll the responses, this world's gone totally bonkers
I sometimes wonder, ""What would I do in the next generation?""
But I'm knowin' the answer, 'cause what am I doin' in this generation?
Afraid to speak cah I don't wanna risk it my occupation
We got kids under occupation, my parents, they wouldn't get that
The people that died for our freedom spoke on justice, couldn't accept that
I talk 'bout the money in all my accounts, so why don't I speak on the West Bank?
Remember growin' up prejudiced, the damage 7/7 did
Extremists and terrorists, I was afraid of the Taliban
Can't speak out on illegal settlers, now I'm afraid of a shadow-ban
What would I do in the next generation?
Critiquin' African leaders
For sellin' our country's natural resources to the West for peanuts
If they don't hear, they'll feel us
I question what I'm alive for
And can you say you're alive if you ain't got somethin' you're willin' to die for?
What am I willin' to die for? What am I doin' in this generation?
I get in my head sometimes, I feel like I'm in despair
That feelin' of total powerlessness, I get that sinkin' feelin'
That good ain't defeatin' evil
I put their pain on vinyl, but feel like that shit ain't movin' the needle
Retweetin' people, raisin' awareness, in all fairness
Ain't gonna bring Chris back to his parents
But there's no other option, it's a process
Gotta stand and protest cah they want man silenced
Cah they want man dead or they want man hopeless
In the next generation, I spoke with my ancestors in the night and I showed them
They spoke with tears in their eyes for the brothers they lost and said it was progress
""How can it be progress?"" I asked them, confused, disgusted
They said, ""David, just so you can fight this, you know how much sufferin' touched us?
And you got a chance, we come from a time and a place where you couldn't get justice
Had to find peace in the fact that we all answer to the one what we trust in
And in our generation, we did do peaceful protests, just like you
Burnt buildings, just like you, did boycotts, just like you
Sat in a hostel powerless, did feel powerless just like you
And I know that it may sound strange, but we made some change and we're just like you
I know that you question your character, I know that you suffer in silence
I know that it don't feel right when you go to the club in Victoria Island
'Cause how can you dance in the club? There's a hundred people beggin' outside it
I know all the sins of your father, I know that you're desperate to fight them
So step in your purpose, speak for your people, share all your secrets
Expose your emotions, you might not see, but there's people that need it
Never demand it, and if God can grant it, manifest it and receive it
Your name is David, and that covenant sacred, you gotta promise you'll keep it""
Deep it, them man talk on the ting, but I bleed it
Man wanna speak on the scene, but I've seen it
Tried in the fire by Ghetts, I'm anointed
Kano passed me the torch, I received it
God told me I'm the one, I believed it
Shout Hollowman 'cause he helped me achieve it
I'm the youngest of my brothers, Father, ease the burden on our mothers
Give these niggas money, see their colours
Don't mix me with them, I'm not the one
Grind and miss the summer, when it comes, I'm Abraham, I sacrifice the sun
Where I'm from, they sacrifice their son
Hold up, I ain't finished, I ain't done
My ancestors, my ancestors told me that my life is prophecy
And it's not just me, it's a whole generation of people gradually makin' change
There ain't a greater task
Shift that, make a name, make a start
They don't know what they're facin' when they ask
With the will of David in my heart

I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)

I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks

But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets

I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board

Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

Come take my hand (Come take my hand)

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies

See you at the bar, you was hardly talkin’
That's when I knew that your heart was scarrin'
Friends to lovers, need a part to star in, like, ""Wait, babe""
Let me ask your pardon
This ain’t Gucci, this is Prada, darlin'
If you want somethin', you can ask me, darlin'
Then you started laughin' 'cause you think I'm jokin'
But lookin’ in your eyes is the best thing
Brake lights givin’ you the red skin
You was in a bad mood from we stepped in
Though you checked out 'fore we even checked in
On the phone you gon’ vent to your best friend
The one who gave me the lecture, but I ain't gon' sweat you, babe
I'ma let you catch up with your boy, undress you
And let me tell you why I’ma bless you

It's the way my mind fallin' away
In my heart, I know
You feel the same when you're with me
You know I'm all you need
You're where I wanna be
My darling, can't you see?

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

Fell into you
Say you want me in the mood
Tryna hide my feelings for you
Don't wanna argue, not with you
Tell me why you're so in denial
Hold me close, don't tell me goodnight
Are you down to get me?
Tell me when you're ready, I'm ready (
Yeah

We can get into it or we can get intimate
The shower when you sing in it
Better than Beyoncé, I like the sound of fiancée
You know, it's got a little ring to it
And really when I think of it
Growin' up, I didn't ever see marriages
No weddings, no horse, no carriages
I wanna do things different and change the narrative
God knows you a wild child, beautiful child, I need your help
Lookin' like you come from the '90s by yourself
My mum sixty-one and her favourite line to tell her son is
Sometimes she wish that she had a girl (
Girl
)
I wanna take you back to a time, back to a trip
You had that white wine that I never got to sip
And dinner wasn't ruined 'cause you never got to pick
I know that everybody told me that I'm sick 'cause

It's the way my mind fallin' away
In my heart, I know
You feel the same when you're with me
You know I'm all you need
You're where I wanna be
My darling, can't you see?

(I love you) Me and you, never let me go

There's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime
We let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmastime

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmastime
It's hard, but when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

Waiting for someone
To sing me his song
So many dreams
I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, ""Hey, I love you,""
Never again
To be all alone

With you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song
'Cause you

Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Singin' to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, ""I only think of you""
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart
I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)

Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
[Breakdown]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into Hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Pleading with your eyes

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song

Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door

But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

I know you're not a fool

I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever

And I will never let you inside them, oh

Clouded mind, heavy head
Crazy thoughts, still paper chasing
I pray I don't lose my mind
All I wanna say is they don't really care, so
I just gotta keep feelings inside
I've been fighting my demons, so don't think my life is picture perfect
I've been sowing seed, so I can have a serious harvest
Could've been drunk in love, don't wanna have a liquor mindset
Cut off bad energy, unleash my scissors aspect
I have my fears 'cause I already taste the good life

But I had to put the right force, got me fighting for the right course
Sometimes e go dey sweet, sometimes e go dey bitter
But what I'm craving inside is to make my family better
While I'm doing so
The devil try to take away my soul
But I refuse to go, got me hustling down from coast to coast
I called the Holy Ghost 'cause it's only Him that can save my boat
I'm sinking deep, I'm sinking deep, I hold your hand in hope
Y'all only see what's going on all on the camera
But hard to see when I'm losing focus and stamina
It's not always about the money and the dough
I'm fighting my own demons, I just thought to let you know
Ah, say, while going through all these
I've got my son to raise
ZTTW, my fashion store and music chase
I'm always on the run, running this human race
I'm always on the road, Oluwa can you take the brake

I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band

But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

A star in the '40s, centerfold in the '50s
Got me trippin' out like the '60s, hippies
Queen of the discotheque
A '70s dream and an '80s best

Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions
[Verse 1]
I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet paper
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real, I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision

And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions
[Verse 2]
I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, ""Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!""
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' doors

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

Wag kang mag a-alala susuklian ko yan lahat, sayo palang kasi ay kuntento na ako’t sapat

Nalulungkot ako kapag hindi ka na kasama, namimiss kita palagi pag hindi ka nakikita

Tao lang naman kasi tayo at nagkakamali
Di maiwasan ang mali kahit alam nangang mali
Kaya patawad na mahal sa mga nagawang mali, hayaan mo akong muli at sayo na makabawi
Papa-alala ko sayo kung pano ka sumasaya, nuong nag sisimula palang nun tayong dalawa
Nag haharutan sa daan at magka hawak ang kamay, grabe kapa nun tumawa ang lakas mong mag ingay

Yeah, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stake for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial
But way more error (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

[Verse 1]
Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spin for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' a lot of cappin', watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of thе witness

Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been supеrstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

Remember when we was jackin' cars

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Kutthroat Businezz, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get out, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm on probation

I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in LA
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?
[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

[Verse 2]
The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count

If this could make me happy

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

Stolen kisses, pretty lies

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn

Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce

But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

Un angelo a entrambi i lati del mio letto in un sogno
Che canta: ""Tu non sai cosa stai per ottenere ancora
E sei destinato a certa merda a cui non crederesti mai""

Ho degli alberi, una foresta, farai meglio a crederci
Grazie ai bassi e gli acuti, triplico il salario
Non posso augurare il meglio alla mia ex, perché finirebbe di nuovo con me
Come posso dormire quando ci sono soldi da fare con il tеam?
Tu manchi di rispetto al 16, la tua testa sarà su un paletto
Pеr la brama dei soldi, la testa della Regina
Ho fatto certa merda per cui non credo potrei mai redimermi

Ma è facile quando ti dichiarano morto sulla scena
Quindi quando mi vedi su questi palchi salire così puro
Io spero

Ti diranno che sono già una leggenda (Stiamo facendo)
Streatham è ciò che rappresento, passi sicuri, bro, devi scordartelo

E il mio ego è aggressivo (Yeah), farai meglio a lasciarmi un messaggio

Sparito per un paio di estati, così ora gli manco sul beat (Woo)

Se non è B, non può nemmeno baciarmi sulla guancia (Yeah)

Sai che stiamo facendo la storia (la storia)

Beh, è tutto ciò che volevo

Verso qualcosa di più alto (Alto)

Sono ispirato
E mi sto tenendo stretto a una versione delle nostre vite
In cui tu sei ancora mia

Sai che stiamo facendo la storia (Ooh)
Dovremmo farla? Oh Dio

Mamma mi ha detto cosa significa davvero il mio nome e il potere che c'è dentro
Mi ha fatto pensare a quei giorni in cui ero una vittima di questa cosa
Pensando che l'avrei mantenuta in equilibrio
Ero anche imbarazzato, a vendere CD a Parigi
Ma questa musica mi ha dato tutto ciò di cui ho bisogno in un matrimonio
Non posso parlare male del grime, della jungle o del garage
Quando so che è la ragione per cui siamo riusciti a fare (La storia)
Non fare l'eroe, non sto cercando di fare male a nessuno
Ne ho una pulita e ne ho una più sporca
Non ho mai visto un uomo arrivare tardi al suo funerale, ma
Ne ho visto uno arrivare presto al suo
Preferisco quella magra, ma non mi dispiace quella più formosa, yeah
E provengo dal South del fiume, dove il cielo è nero
Se non fosse per la storia che abbiamo fatto, a loro non piacerebbe il rap
Negri cercano di annacquare la nostra roba, è tempo di reagire
Per settanta ore, sono entrato in possesso dei poteri, e sono definitivamente nostri, è tempo
Mi hai nominato, meglio che tu sappia che stai giocando col pepe
Hai preso in prestito un milione, e io gli ho detto di pagarmi comunque
Sapevo che sarebbe stato diverso dal momento in cui siamo arrivati
E poi chiamarmi perché l'ho raccontata alla lettera
La donna con me è come un quadro del rinascimento
Sono il David di Michelangelo
E ogni volta che mi nomini in una dichiarazione, sarà meglio che tu sappia che è

Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""

So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told

We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'

And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife

Lost in your current like a priceless wine

Wherever you stray, I follow

Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

Show me the places where the others gave you scars

To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older
But fuck it, it was somethin' to do
I'm livin' out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

I'm just a singer
Who already blew his shot
I get along with oldtimers 'cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

No, you don't wanna be high like me

I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
Well, my friends are all gone, but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown, yeah
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said, ""Tell us how to make it 'cause we're gettin' real impatient""
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy, or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man,"" 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind

No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down

Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee

Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are

To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town near New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We looked down a river and we see'd the British come
(Hut-two three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drums
(Hut-two three-four)
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
(Hut-two three-four)
We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing
(Hut-two three-four)

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago

(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets 'til we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire 'til we see their faces well

Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we

Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'

They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em

On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round

So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Verse 2]
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
[Bridge 1]
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again

[Bridge 2]
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again

These bitches kill me claiming that they best
Bet you take that bass out ya voice when I cave ya chest
Your 15 minutes of fame been came and left
And I just started bubbling yall bitches are in trouble man
One phone call and you finished cuz my squad stay on the double
Man we got cannons, handguns and toys that go blam-o-blam
I dont think ya mans and dem' understand that
When my boys get tight they'll pop like a rubberband
And you when you get shot its gone shock all ya other mans
Like when SDot brought in JL that SummerJam see
I'm Remy Ma see to tell the truth I dont give a fuck
I do all yall bitches like I did that chick in Lady Duck
Sleazy, I swear to God it's too easy but
I can't stop now the industry needs me nigga

You wanna get it poppin bitches?
Ok Lets get it on
U wanna see Remy just pop a bitch then?
Well lets get it on
It cost u 20 just to hear her spit (Listen)

C'mon Lets get it on
U wanna get it popping bitches
Ok lets get it on
You wanna see Remy just pop a bitch then?
Well lets get it on

A few years ago I was really tryna be lenient
Since yall acting like  fried chickens I'ma do yall greasy
Believe me Remy is of the heazy I run shit round here
Like my name was M-Easy
Ain't a need for u to ask where Rem been
You know I'm getting guap , when the face of my watches spinning
I got BET all on me, MTV calling me
The cover of the XXL, and The Source see
The Vibe is next, they signing checks left and right
Everyday I'm catching flights was in LA last night Miami this morning
See I can go thru any weather , curls got me G-foreign
So when I say I gets fly
I really be getting fly
Smoking haze on the plane or then really I'm getting high
And you just be getting by looking for a handout
Stop Hummer stunting you frontin let the can hang out nigga

Look Pun opened the door and now I'm in it
Terrors the squads and cook coke Cracks the lieutenant
I always thought of Remy Martin as a sergeant
But I'm cool being a kernel cuz now I'm poppin'
I spit so butter I'm still so gutter
Switched up and still flows like no other
I'm like yea yea yeah lean back
I'm in a NY state of mind stressed , like where the fuck the pheens at?
Cuz I got that crack
And I ain't talking bout a pack
See my niggas gone dont make me have to bring em back

We shine like that travels and waves that are unbelievable
Distance and days

Picture so beautiful, I had to film the pilot
Coined a new grand of philosophy
That form images in your mind, quite different from photography
Anointed few, a point of view of the thinkers
No pitch, that's a glitch full of hook lines, and sinkers
The way the wise look at light, the manner of the thoughtful
There is no benefit if it's not resourceful
Four to five, the observers, they get something from it
It become routine, been there and done it
I'm in a place where perception is developed

Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)

To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)

Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no

But I didn't wanna eat that humble pie, no, I

Father God, forgive me
It's been a couple years, there may be more that I ain't prayed
Even longer I ain't been to church, God, I'm ashamed
Embarrassed of my ways, but still, I'm askin' for Your grace
Feel like I been led astray
By the drinkin' and the spirits I let take me when I ride
And the ladies in the night
Most people, they got demons, I got angels that I fight

Abdullah died at sixteen, and I still feel that same rage
Cah we all gettin' older and he still the same age
It's his twenty-seventh birthday, in his pic, he's fourteen
Back when we would all dream
There's Stephanie, she lived at fourteen
And he lived at number seventeen, and I was number twelve
When I used to think that if I'd skip church, I go to Hell
So when they ask about grief and how it feels, I know it well
I missed his tenth anniversary in 2024
I know the value of this picture, we ain't gettin' any more
Then I go, and I get angry, God, like, ""Why'd you take him for?""
He was just a baby
All these emotions that I'm feelin', it's the strength I pray for
God, for anyone that's with us that can vouch I pray for
Pray that I feel less lonely in this house I prayed for
I pray that

Yeah
With this cross that you bear on me
Can you look after my mum? She probably used her last prayer on me
Can't let the Devil in, there's repentance in the Bible, God, remind my ex of this
Feel like we was meant for this, move mountains and boulders
We at them ages where our parents gettin' older, may they never need a shoulder
I done shit I can't condone, wrote sermons on my own
I'm in church, more worried 'bout the service on my phone
And on Judgement Day, are You gonna write it in my sins?
Cah my nigga, he got cancer, and I'm lyin' to his kids
God, I'm tryin', but it hits me in my heart
I done lost so many niggas that's been with me from the start
Then I pray for quick change and I ain't even try it fast
All I ever did was ask, shattered glass, crucifixes on my chest
Pray to purchase a Patek, for my church, they cut a check
How am I tryna pray for Congo with these diamonds on my neck?
There's a father and there's a son
Pray that I can show him how to love a woman through his mum
Because I never got the chance, and I just want the best
For my three little nieces that I carry on my chest
I'm prayin' for my managers, I'm prayin' for their wives
'Cause God knows that they're the ones that sacrifice their lives
I would've said their names, but God, you know who I mean
I'm prayin' for my brothers, God, protect us on the streets
I had the steak at Carbone and didn't pray before I eat
It's like I call You when I need You, and I don't, we don't speak
Ground rules for my niggas found schools back at Lambeth Town Hall
I helped him pray, but didn't know that it was on my downfall
So when I'm ice cold

When no blood is in my veins, numbers on my days
Will I say I love this life of rain?
I'm just prayin' that my purpose can justify my pain
I'm just prayin' that my purpose can justify my pain

My mum used to creep in my room and put oil and a cross on my head
Anoint me and probably read a verse like Psalm 23
""The Lord is my shepherd"", and maybe Matthew 4
""The word is my weapon tonight""
If I can't pray for peace, then I just pray we win the war
It's been twenty-six years, I don't know what I'm fightin' for
Well, maybe it's a place to fill your everlastin' light
In a world where kids that die get a second chance at life
Christ, I don't know what to say to You
I pray to You, forgive me for the days I had a reason to
And I ain't had faith in You
You did it for the sake of me and how I've forsaken You
I prayed for new shoes and I used them to walk away from You
Made it out with drugs, swapped the pen for the needles
And I just found a different way to poison my people
You could say it's testimony that I'm tellin' them my story
But how we sellin' them the Devil, still givin' God the glory?

E anche quando abbiamo condiviso gli schermi, non sono riuscito a parlarti di persona
Ho domande del tipo: ""Come ce l'hai fatta?"", ""Hai dei rimpianti?"", tipo, ""Com'è la tua vita?""
Vedi, la mia era tipo come il tramonto
Pregando che la luna brillasse, è la proibizione, niente accensione
Guido due feste, è la coalizione
Rum e Red Bull, come Max Verstappen, ma la competizione è diversa
Il sapore è diverso, ci sono stripper nella mia pole position
I giovani muoiono come se avessero salvato la partita e potessero ricaricare la missione
Portando gioielli, ho sentito che stanno complottando contro di me quando cammino per il quartiere
E' South London, qualcosa che non puoi insegnare a Streatham è il buon senso
Mangiando in modo salutare perché ci fidiamo della nostra pancia più che dei nostri amici
Troppe truffe, tanti uomini sono falsi, troppi imitatori, innovatori
Prendo quella merda a cuore come un defibrillatore, pah, pah, pah
Madri versano lacrime e non dormono per giorni, piangono per giorni
E gli assassini festeggiano con un'identificazione, e così hai questa scena che affronto
E questa pressione che ho ereditato da te, è ironico, ma è vero
Ti ho amato sul grande schermo, ma fra, voglio che torni
Perché quello che la recitazione ha guadagnato con te, l'abbiamo persa nel rap

Hai un sacco di anni davanti a te
Alcuni anni ti peggioreranno e altri ti miglioreranno
Se non è positivo, mollalo, il residuo delle strade
Ma mantieni un pezzo di te stesso quando ti venderai
Questo gioco non è per il trono, e i re sono controllabili
E' per essere una versione migliore di te, l'invidia è inevitabile
E per favore fatti delle foto con i tuoi amici perché te lo dico
Questa attenzione dell'industria spezza le crew
E un sorso diventa una dipendenza dal succo della gelosia
Finché non ti insulteranno ancora come se non li avessi sfamati
Ma se vai in giro con una Cullinan davanti a dei giovani disperati
Se sfoggi una Benz, allora il diavolo te la farà pagare
Queste sono le regole
Ce l'hai fatta, goditela, questo letto non è nuovo
Ma manteniamolo vero, sai che sei imprudente con i Patek e i gioielli
Gli sfrontati fanno quello che fanno gli sfrontati, e gli approfittatori fanno quello che fanno gli approfittatori
Guardati le spalle ogni volta che giri una chiave
Riguardo al porgere l'altra guancia, un uomo deve essere un uomo maturo?
So che tiene a bada il fuoco, ma è una massa di giganti
Questi fanno congetture, tieni alto il mento, Tu sei un compratore di Aston
E sarò anche fazioso, ma la mia generazione ha dei veri scrittori
La tua generazione, che è per lo più la tua penna, tu sei il messia del rap
Tu e Simbi, andatevi a prendere i riconoscimenti che non avrebbero mai dato a me
Ma questa è un'altra storia, non sono diventato una leggenda per la gloria
Un paio di trofei nel mio ripostiglio, povero me
Un Ivor Novello non valuta un uomo, così sia
Nel 2003 ero sul mic a fare casino
Pensi che saresti emerso nella mia era sui 140?
E' facile dividere il jollof con te, scambiarci la conoscenza
Ma scusami per non aver trovato il tempo al Troxy
Ho visto il tuo soundcheck quel giorno, ho visto una promessa
Poi sono venuto al tuo show all'O2, ho visto la brillantezza
Ma durante tutti i fuochi d'artificio, io riflettevo, tipo
Hai una famiglia, progetti e problemi?
Riuscirai mai a capire quando sei solo il portafoglio di qualcuno?
Hai mai sentito l'odore di una cuginanza che diviene marcia?
Dimmi, hai mai ascoltato tuo fratello e hai iniziato a piangere?
Dimmi, hai mai toccato un milione e ti sei sentito distaccato?
Dimmi, hai mai assaporato la vittoria e non l'hai voluta?
Questi cinque sensi avranno senso per i veri capi
Io ho un sesto senso per sapere chi lo è davvero
Un rissoso di Bond Street, riconosco chi ha la stessa pasta, so cosa offre il gioco
Divenuto un esperto, mi cuocio al sole finché non riposerò in una bara, eredità
Si ricorderanno di me, Dave?

Beh, credo che non possiamo saperlo, questo è il motivo per cui ci svegliamo, ce lo prendiamo da soli
E mi piacerebbe dirti di sì, ma fratello, me lo chiedo anche di me stesso
Salute, benessere, felicità, tutto ciò di cui qualcuno ha veramente bisogno
E un po' d'acqua da poter dare al mio seme (Uh-huh)
Cuore freddo come Courchevel, anima Chanel
Occhiali di tartaruga che ho comprato a questa ragazza
Sono andato in tour per il mondo, l'amore, sembra che non riesca a trovarlo
Queste sono le cazzate che faccio per le donne, non mi piacciono neanche
Bro, ho bisogno di una guida
Guid-? Bro, non sono un consulente di relazioni
Ma tutta questa difesa non ti permetterà di colpirla
Dio ama uno che ci prova, David ama una bugia
Ma anche un'arpa è una metà di un cuore, quindi perché Cupido potrebbe colpire?
Ayy, da dove viene questa stavolta? Fai quello che sai fare, bro
Ogni volta che ti vedo, nuova roba, bro
Perché tu non ti leghi, tu fai Duolingo
Ayy, grande bro
Non so da dove hai avuto quella info, ma non ero io
Ne ho bisogno per iscritto
Ma comunque, amo il gioco, è affascinante
Mi sono trasferito a Ovest ed è bello, e questi giorni, che stai guidando?
Ah, hai uno stile di vita borghese (Ah)
Stile di vita borghese (Ah, fico)
Prima guidavo una Porsche argentata con due sedili (certo che lo facevi)
Sedili in pelle, ora comodi seggiolini per bambini nel SUV
Tu sai che sono stato in Nigeria e non ho mai mangiato Egusi (Quindi, fra, cosa mangiavi?)
Platino fritto
Non mangiavi la zuppa piccante, G?
E si dice ""Platano""
Ma fidati, quello è tutto Gucci, ascolta
(D'accordo, eccoci)
Ero in Jamaica che mangiavo una zuppa di zampe di vacca
Nel bel mezzo di Greenwich come se fossi un vero giovane del ghetto
Sono andato in centro lunedì e i miei amici hanno sparato (Pump, pump, pump)
Non fotto con la ganja, ma comunque mi fumo uno zoot
Mi ha fatto sentire come (Come)
Se dovessi avere gli occhi sul retro della testa (Giusto)
Televisione della Range Rover, interni rossi (Interni rossi)
Mi sono addormentato in macchina perché sembrava un letto (Ahah)
Voglio solo ringraziare per questa vita che -
Guarda, mic check, uno, due, cene gratis a scuola
Ora saccheggiamo il Saxa per una vita con più sapore
Raccoglierò soldi per riportare indietro i cattivi pacifici
Perché questi trentotto anni, sono una condanna crudele
Tipo: ""Non ti amo più""
Dave, prima ero sposato col gioco, ora non sono più un marito
Tutti quei SM7B non fanno per noi come prima
Mike ci ha fatto Billi Jean con quelli, ora ci discutono riguardo un paio di guerre
E ci imbrogliano
Inseguire le banconote è grandioso finché non sono documenti di divorzio
Giornali, fogli di tribunale, guidano le mie macchine
Parlano dei tuoi rifiuti, poi dividono le tue volontà
Questo è come si sente la famiglia, crescendo così velocemente
Ventisei, mi sento come se le nostre vite fossero un timer
Rughe sulla faccia, lei si fa i filler per nasconderle
E le troie mentono sulla loro età come attaccanti della Nigeria
Scusi, cameriere, può mettermi questo cibo in delle scatole?
Dovevo andarmene, era pericoloso
Ho visto posti bellissimi, bro, prima avevo l'apparecchio
Ora il mio autista è sul libro paga
Ma questo è solo un testamento per Dio e il Suo favore
E, fra, volevo un favore
Vediamoci di più, becchiamoci e creiamo delle opere
Perché ai fan gli manchi, conosco i fan, manco anche a loro
Facciamo un pezzo su questa cena e questa impronta che mi hai dato
E lo basiamo sul Libro di Samuele, lo chiamiamo ""Chapter 16"" se sei d'accordo

Quindi chi se ne occupa di questo?
Ok, va bene
Quindi come si chiama lei?
Nah, ti sto solo prendendo per il culo, fai il tuo, amico
Ma fidati di me, non pensarci troppo
Tipo come viene viene, se diventerà qualcosa allora sarà qualcosa
Ma, ma ti conosco, so come sei fatto
Tu pensi cinque, dieci anni in avanti

Damn Kai, you goin' crazy

[Verse 1]
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friends, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bro, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we're the who's who's?
Still run around with mohawk, Jet ready, pack the Goyard
People think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is ""Baby, keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick divided
Bro ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be knowin' the rundown, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come check, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full court press, foot on they neck and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat and tears come with these checks and it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gone get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' playdoh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spend good, I'm on my way to Clayco
AK47s in the spots before they made the Draco
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill, I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill, I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuyin' cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'm gonna pull up and spray that
Livin' like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like yo mama with the switch ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bro taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""

Behold my crown of broken glass
Behold the golden light it casts
The cast behind the curtain
I can hear them whispering
Just soft enough
The audience won't know a thing
Awake, awake
He says, “Ladada Ladada”
The same refrain
She says, “Ladada Ladada”
This distant pain
It says, “Ladada Ladada”
Barely felt but never seems to fade
I say, ""Ladada, Ladada""
I awaken in a chamber that is best described ventricular
This devil in the details, inoculating the particular
Before my bеarings catch, might I ask the occasion
Demanding a solution to this refеrential equation
The architect, the man, the wreck
No sense of space, cause, or effect
The dreamer builds within the dream
What did you possibly expect?
Constructing conversations, calculating the ephemeral
His paradigm, his point of view quixotic and untenable
His elegiac edifice found empty, if dimensional
Very much the model of a modern major general
(hahaha)
But his brother is a mechanist, it memorizes all it's lines
And thinks itself director, saying, ""one more time, hey, one more time.""
His sister is a hypnotist, a crocodile in the mirror
Drags and drowns him in the lens, most often when the water's clear
He says, ""Ladada, Ladada""

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta

You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' 'round lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes

So stick by his side

While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

Look

White fish on the coast of the Caribbean, my life is a film
Hero and villain, I'm playin' both in the script
Worthy of Spielberg or Christopher Nolan readin'
The constant overachievin', I know
I ain't as rich as them people with old money, but I didn't know money
They mock me online for speakin' up on all of our issues
And bein' vocal, the shit that I see on socials
But how can I stay silent when, when
I'm out in Barbados, white people mistreatin' locals
The villa in Jamaica, but it's owned by the Chinese
Head to the right bеach and they're chargin' us five еach
They say the Caribbean paradise, like, why leave?
But how can I be silent when there's blood on the pine trees?
Most of us would sacrifice our soul for the right fees
Before I find love, I'm just prayin' I find peace
Before I find love, I'm just prayin' I find peace
You know what I believe, I don't know if I handled it well
It's fuck Coca-Cola, did I stop drinkin' Fanta as well?
I could see the blood on the lyrics I write for myself
I cried about slavery, then went to Dubai with my girl
""Surely I ain't part of the problem"", I lie to myself
Jewels that my people die for are a sign of my wealth
My work is a physical weight of my life and my health
The last couple years, felt like I been inside on a shelf
I just phoned Cench, and I said, ""You inspired myself""
I don't feel a spot of jealousy inside of myself
But when I'm all alone, I won't lie, I question myself
Am I self-destructive? Am I doin' the best for myself?
I know I love music, but I question the rest of myself
Like, why don't you post pictures? Or why don't you drop music?
Or why not do somethin' but sittin' and stressin' yourself?
Ten years I been in the game and I won't lie, it's gettin' difficult
This shit used to be spiritual
We don't need no commentators, we could leave that to the sports
Just listen to the music, why do you need somebody's thoughts?
And some of it constructive, but most of it is forced
And why we countin' the numbers, how the music make you feel?
I'm just bein' real
(Alright)

Yeah
White fish on the coast of the Caribbean, my life is a film
Hero and villain, I'm playin' both in the script
Worthy of Oscar and Hollywood nominations
I'm throwin' money at women in different denominations and killin' the conversation
All them people told me, ""Keep grindin', be patient""
It's weird bein' famous, tryna navigate the spaces
Feel like a celebrity, but you ain't on the A-list
And you never drop, so you ain't really on a playlist
But your fans love you, you can see it on their faces
America feels so close that you can taste it
2017, was tryna make it to the ranges
2025, I'm tryna make it to the Grainges
How do I explain me and my soulmate are strangers
That we've already met and I've known her for ages?
How do I explain? Because I'm runnin' out of pages
How do I explain South London and its dangers?
Can't recall the last time that we was all together, but
All I can remember, the Olympics was in Beijing
Move to Dubai, that's for the taxes that they takin'
Or move to Qatar, feel the breeze on the beach
But how can I explain to my kids that it's fake wind?
Free, but I'm broke, have me feelin' like I'm caged in
How do I explain two pounds got you eight wings?
How do I explain my opps lost, but we ain't win?
Girls I'm around had surgery on their hips
How do I explain that I love her the way she is?
How do I explain my feelings on having kids?
That it wasn't what it was, but it is what it is
How do I explain my niggas are in the hood?
And they don't ask for nothin' even though they know they could
'Cause they rather trap, rob and get it on their own
How do I explain these messages on my phone?
I just got a call, my girl's sittin' in the car
And it says ""Serge"", but Serge with us in the car
I know I might sound like a villain from afar
How do I explain that my mechanic is a chick?
Or why she callin' me when I don't even own a whip because my licence is revoked?
I mean, how do I explain that I don't wanna heal 'cause my identity is pain?
How do I explain, I mean, how do I explain?
I went and hit the streets because I didn't want a boss
I ended up a worker, I was barely gettin' paid
For someone that was two years above me in my age
I didn't even find it strange, I mean, how do I explain?

Yeah
Fifty-two miles from Marseilles, I'm in Miraval
Four years, seventeen days, I ain't been around
I can't lie, it even shocks me that I'm still around
I can't lie, it even shocks me how I'm livin' now
Starin' at this Rachel Jones paintin', I'm sittin' down
The last thing I drew was a weapon, I'm livin' wild
Turned twenty-seven, but I feel like I'm still a child
In this house out in Central London I can barely afford
Six months sober and I feel like I'm Dave again
Drinkin' all my pain and my sorrows away again
I got withdrawal symptoms, but they happen at ATMs
Next two years, I'll be lookin' at eighty M's
Who's the best artist in the world? I'm sayin' Tems
Maybe James Blake or Jim, on the day, depends
Let's see who quits now we ain't gettin' paid again, yeah
I'm just here drinkin' liquor by myself
Is my music just becomin' a depiction of my wealth?
Never trust a girl whose lock screen's a picture of herself, I had to learn that shit myself
Now I'm sittin' by myself with no girl, like, shit, I really did this to myself
Twenty-seven and I'm terrified of livin' by myself 'cause there's a kid inside myself I haven't healed
And me and him debate each other
I can't love myself, I'm made from two people that hate each other
My parents couldn't even save each other, made each other unhappy
Used to be excited by the block, but size doesn't matter
You supplyin' it or not? Sling a shot, I could've really killed a giant with a rock
But that's a life that I forgot, and my young boys are slidin' over what?
I don't know 'cause I ain't spoke to him in time
Been afraid of gettin' older, scared of bein' left behind
And then I, and then I question, will I live my life in resent?
Is anybody ever gonna take my kindness for strength?
I gave Tisha the world, it weren't enough and then she went
Everybody's makin' content, but nobody's content
Safe space, can I vent? It crept up
My girl cheated on me when I was next up
It made me want her even more, man, it's messed up
I still walk around the Vale with my chest out
I don't wanna leave my house because I'm stressed out
You done me dirty and you didn't even tell a lie
It ain't about what you said, it's what you left out
My whole life, I been feelin' like I'm left out
If you fuck another girl, she say you cheated on her
And if she fuck another man, she say she stepped out
And if you askin' 'bout Dave, they say, ""The best out""
Yeah, and I survived all these eras cah I barely made any, I'm just speakin' how I feel
Yeah, fucked up, speakin' how I feel
Recordin' till the morning, I ain't even had a meal
I dropped Joni home and fell asleep behind the wheel
Drivin' at a hundred an hour, I switched gears
I ain't spoke to 169 in six years
Don't even get me started on—, this shit's weird
Call me what you want, but with music, I'm sincere
You wanna know the reason it's taken me four years?
It's not 'cause I'm surrounded by yes-men and sycophants
It's 'cause I'm with producers and people that give a damn
It's me who's gotta carry the pressure, I live with that
All I thought about was the song we could give the fans
When I was out there gettin' stood up by artists I'm bigger than
I don't want no girls around when my nieces, they visit man
They might see the way that I'm livin', I figured that
I wanna be a good man, but I wanna be myself too
And I don't think that I can do both, so I can't let her too close
It hurts, but I'm still movin', feel like it's me versus me and I'm still losin'

Yo, my boy, it's Josiah, what you sayin'?
You know man had to check you on your fuckin' birthday, my boy
More life, my guy
Man soon out, don't even watch that

If I said that I would love you every single night
Would you ever let me down?

Well, I'm sorry if it sounds kinds sad
It's just that I'm worried
So worried that you'll let me down

Because I love you, love you, love you, so don't let me down

If I said the way I feel for you would never change
Would you ever fool around?

What if I'm overprotective with family because of how mine is?
What if I'm jealous?
Maybe that's what's making me nervous
What if my effort of pullin' you close are pushin' you further?
What if I'm selfish?
What if the reason they call me ""The Greatest""
Is also the reason that me and you livin' on different pages?
What if I'm too much?
What if I settled and I didn't fight?
What if my fear of doin' it wrong's the reason I haven't been doin' it right?
What if I'm selfish?
What if the kids just wanna be kids
And don't wanna live in and out of the news and chill
And don't even wanna be rich?
And what if I'm so self-centred that I don't even realise what I could miss?
And what if I'm, what if I'm fallin' in the abyss?
Maybe it's— (What if I'm—)
Yeah

Maybe it's dark, maybe it's day, maybe it's too many nights in L.A.​
Look at the house in Surrey and still, all of the feelings we hid in the Hills
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me, maybe the media or the provokin'
Gave you my heart, I laid it bare, funny you went and you poked it

Like, what if it's better with me out the way?

What if I'm dangerous and I'm wild?

What if he's broken? What if he's scared?
What if he's ostracised and vilified?
See, peace is just an illusion
Ain't got a home, I live in confusion
What if I'm selfish?

Forever, forever, forever
I manage the symptoms forever
You can love how you want
I know to give is no loss
Can you settle for second
And let go of your idea of heaven?
I know it's a lot
But it might be all that I've got
I wanna throw myself in
Snap off the mask
I want a clown that sings
And a love that lasts
I wanna escape the wedding
Go with you to the carriage
I wanna give you my life
Or at least somethin' to cherish
But what if I'm selfish?

I done a lot of things I regret
Like announcin' our split on a text
Don't know why, but I still buy gifts for my ex
Watchin' her stories to see if she checks
I'm a mess, I don't know if my head's in the game
She told me don't mention her name
I'm suggestin' the same, I'ma get through the pain
Wanna see the sunshine, gotta get through the rain
Bag full of trauma, I left on the train
I'm ashamed for the days that I said that I changed, I'm a cheat
Sat in a therapist chair cryin' like a baby in the middle of a Harley Street
Like I'm fightin' this sickness that I can't beat, I'm disloyal
And then I go mad, reflection tellin' me I'm just like my dad
And this white woman tellin' me it ain't so bad
Middle of my sentence she cut me off, like, ""Sorry, David, we don't have any more time
Your appointment till 4 and it's 3:55""
Bruh, I feel like she wouldn't even care if I died
Man, I tried all this therapy shit, man, I tried all this therapy shit
Bruh, I know, wouldn't even say I'm depressed
But I'm low in the Grosvenor Casino in Edgware Road
I've got too many sins to atone and a voice in my head, like
At this point, like, at this point where you should've been rich, like
At this point where you should've had kids, like
At this point, should've built you a life, like
Look around you, don't you feel you're behind? Like
Look around you, don't you feel you're behind? Like
Look around you, don't you feel like, like
What if I never find love?
Don't know if it's scarier, the thought of us two together or bein' alone
I'm so used to bein' alone
What if I'm somebody nobody wants?
What if I'm damaged? Or what if I waited too long
And have mould on me? What if I'm cold on me?
What if I cut off the hand that I hold on me?
What if I'm rapidly spiralin' and tired and jaded?
Or what if I'm faded? Or what if anxiety's growin' inside me
That I might have left all my best years behind me?
Or what if I'm scared as I touch twenty-seven
That you don't appear in my idea of heaven?

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

She was twenty-four
Last week, told me somethin' you can't be ready for
I mourn the death of her innocence
I mourn the death of her innocence, let the Henny pour
Some weeks ago, she was in a cab
I felt sick to my stomach 'cause when I listen back
Driver was actin' all forward, I should've drawn the line
She wasn't worried about it, it happens all the time
All the time, said it happens all the time
A little conversation, that's just all it is
Ask couple questions, then he'll call it quits
He ain't even have to ask her where she lives
She was headed to this venue with a couple friends
And I was workin' late, said I'd collect her when the party ends
She goin' to this no-phone party
You know the ones where guys have their phones and all the women there don't
I threw one of them last week, so I don't wanna speak
And when I think about this shit, it cuts deep
You see, Tamah, she like my little sis
So when I asked her to explain to me the story, she said this

I caught a vibe with a guy and then from the off
But somethin' was off, offer me pills and offer me shots
And off of my head, couldn't even say if I was sober or off of my head
I could've danced for days, wouldn't have been a surprise
But let's have a good night, these times are havin' good nights when all the men start drinkin'
And then they feel entitled to more than opinions
You know how that goes and man come to the girls like, ""Fuckin' let me get your Snap', innit
Add me back, innit, fuckin' what?
What you doin' after this? What you on? What's wrong?
Why you movin' so stiff? Come back to the AP, what, friend, what?
Don't worry 'bout her, you ain't her dad, that's long
Why follow her home? Call her a cab or what
I feel like I seen you before, what, you from Bex? You know Thames? Fuckin'
Are you gettin' back to ends?""
And I ain't sayin' that's weird, but it kinda is
She busy throwin' up, he's tryna take her to the crib
But that's the culture of the club, right?
All game's fair
And if she don't like it, why she there?
These times, she just wanna go home
But she don't wanna go alone with no battery on her phone
And all her friends are tryna stay
Cah they goin' to somebody's afterparty in a house that's out the way
And then she blacked out
She was gonna leave with them, but somethin' felt off
And then she backed out
When I heard about the time she tried to make it home alone
She said

At Archway, I got out the car
It's quiet and I'm walking up this long hill
Faint sound, cold chills
I swear I just heard a familiar voice
Inside of the club, outside of the club
Was it that first cab? I swear I know the voice
Think fast, that's my only choice
He's comin' up, I hear him runnin' up
I ran and I trip, I fell and I buckle
My belt in a buckle, my keys in my knuckles
He's grabbin' my hair, I'm screamin' to stop
I'm hittin' him hard, it's turnin' him on
The burnin' is gone, my body is so cold and frozen in fear
Acceptin' my fate, his hands on my waist
I think that I threw my keys in his face
I ran and he chased
I stumbled on a group of three that were leavin'
I ran towards them, didn't notice that my feet, they were bleedin'
And that's when I called, prayin' that you'd be there recordin'
The only person that I know who's up at 3 in the mornin'
I sound mad
But if you ain't a girl, I guess you don't know the feelin'
Of watchin' what you wear because you're worried 'bout makin' it home
Walkin' with your phone to your ear and you ain't on the phone
Can't walk on the same side of the pavement alone
Everyone's a fucking good guy and they're makin' it known
But I'm just makin' it known that if you ain't a girl, I guess you don't know the feelin'
Of checkin' the child lock, or seein' the AirTag
A five-minute walk home feelin' like five miles
Maybe if these people would police our cities way they police our bodies
Then maybe, fucking hell
Maybe every woman that I know wouldn't be stuck as well
Danger doesn't look like no killer in a mask
It looks like that flirty cab driver
And guys that feel entitled 'cause you're standin' in their section
Short-tempered men, the ones who struggle with rejection
I knew a girl called

That was in so deep, she thought violence was affection
I ain't know some women wouldn't want a man's help
Because so many of 'em want the same reward for their protection
Danger doesn't look like no killer in a mask
It looks like that kid in the group chat that jokes about—
And he won't ever stop because there's no one to correct him
And he might even do it cah the system would protect him
Algorithm gonna find some people just like him
They hate women too, okay, yeah, fuck it, let's connect him
Homicidal femicidal shit on their suggested
Somebody just asked you on a date, it was your dentist
He just went upstairs and got your number from reception
Used to be nice, said I remind him of his little girl
Two weeks later, he wants a sexual connection
Danger doesn't look like no killer in a mask
Who you even talkin' to?
Women hunted down by the people they say report it to
Honestly, I wouldn't have the solitude or fortitude
Try and humanise, she could be somebody's daughter, you
As if that's the reason them fellas shouldn't slaughter you
God forbid that they offend the people you're belongin' to
Objectify you just the way I do in every song
Tamah was never wrong

Can't trust guys, she never lied
No menicide, it femicide
The catcalls, the long stares
The kind words, the lines blurred
Call her out, impersonate her
All know a victim, don't know a perpetrator
Am I one of them? The men of the past
Who catcalled or spoke in the bars?
I'm complicit, no better than you
I told stories of—, yeah
Can't sit on the fence, that's hardly an option

Broke down barriers of language and races

From the valleys

Lo nuestro no depende de un pacto
Disfruta y sólo siente el impacto
El boom boom que te quema, ese cuerpo de sirena
Tranquila que no creo en contratos (y tú menos...)

Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí, y felices los 4
No importa el qué dirán, nos gusta así

How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
(Great John on the beat by the way)
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and—

Ayy, I don't wanna die young, so I stay with a stick
Still on that shit, fuck two times six
Forgot who I was, let me talk my shit, like
Sturdiana, buss a move when I get up behind ya
Shorty bad, she get it from her mama
I do what I do and she do what she wanna
That's a fact and no cap
Me and Sheff had to run up them racks
If you miss then we doublin' back
2018, I was stuck in the trap
Fell in love and I got too attached
Heart got broke, it ain't no comin' back
If we up it, ain't no comin' back
Fuck with my opps, said they no comin' back
Is you with it?, If you up it, I up it, let's get it
Sleepy ain't feel no love in a minute
But, fuck it 'cause I ain't been broke in a minute
And your bitch hit me up said she just wanna fuck
'Cause she ain't feel the strokes in a minute
You know me, I be hittin' it different
So you can't get it back when I'm finished
So you can't get it—
When l'm cookin,' l'm not in the kitchen
I'm probably somewhere outta town doing business
So, I'm sorry if I couldn't kick it
I got attached, so I had to go missin'
Said she love me that's part of my mission
Niggas be fake, gotta keep 'em a distance
Baby stop all that trippin', you should just listen
Three words, my body different

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (Ayy)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and—

I don't wanna die young that might make mama crazy
No ocean I'm too wavy
No therapy could save me
Took L's been winnin' lately
Locked in ain't no escapin'
Sometimes I get impatient
Mask on, no face no, cases, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fall back, baby I gotta breathe
Fear nobody, I'm ready to bleed
And she for the streets, she not for me
From a place where they never believe
In the hood, thought I never would leave
Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knock as he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive
You seen what I seen then you'd probably agree
Cops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief
And mama told me not to play in these streets
It's too late 'cause l'm playin' for keeps

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (I don't wanna die young)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy

La fête est finie, bellek si tu restes près d'la cabine
J'ai du respect pour personne
Maintenant que j'sais qu'même les vrais gars tapinent
Laisse-les voir qu'ça arrive, ça va être l'enfer
Quand j'vais lâcher les lines de mes versets sataniques
Ils veulent tous percer en s'gavant mais t'sais quoi ?
Avant on va leur péter la jambe et les doigts
Va y avoir des tumeurs, secousses sismiques, des ""au secours"", sisi
C'coup-ci c'est 2Fingz et des fumeurs d'pelouse qui kickent

T'attends le kush, gars, j'te vends du cauchemar
En plus j'te mets des touchdowns avec le sens de Ice, man
Pas l'temps pour les loss-bards et leur Rap de ienclards
Hé les gars, il est temps que j'parle
De ces 'tasses et d'leurs équipes
J'fais que livrer que de l'anthrax, gars, c'est dans l'sac
Que se que cachera ta tête, bane de schmets, fuck ce MC faux
J'passe par la fenêtre, si tu captes
Il est temps d'back toutes mes phases
C'est les comebacks de mes Zoulouminatis, nigga

J'écouterai jamais l'avis d'une péripatéticienne, laisse-nous faire
Des couplets qui n'excitent pas les petites chiennes
Ça sent le souffre, les gens m'redoutent
Je tranche le cou d'la prod et je file par les rizières
Tout ça sans prendre de sous, impitoyable quand je l'ouvre
Avant d'décapiter l'King, je m'allume un spliff royal
20 000 poignards arrivent vers toi, j'fais l'signe de la victoire
Avec mes 2Fingz, le style libre t'a mis des doigts

Trop d'putes nègres sur l'net, ils bavent trop
Tu sais que j'fais pas d'tubes mais ils sont tous accros d'ma daube
Je n'ai pas de'voiture, mec, cependant
J'ai toujours un budget Ralph Lauren dans mon cash-flow
Pas d'futur pour les gosses libres, fais tapiner
La fille de Roselyne Bachelot, roule comme Ryan Gosling
Demande à Eff, on est wavy, ouais, le Phaal
N'est pas discret mais j'disparais comme Patrick Swayze

J'ai toujours habité Crimée 19 !
J'suis celui qui n'voulait pas quitter le lycée
Matrixé vite fait, j'me méfie de tout car trop d'amitiés brisées
Mais qui c'est c'type ? Eff Gee maîtrise les skills
De qualité prisée, physique de perdre, lyrics de traître
Fermez vos gueules avec toutes vos gimmicks de merde
Frérot, les bails sont rues, les femmes sont nues
Avec 2Fingz, on t'fait des tas de bons trucs

V'là le gars qui débarque une fois tous les 6 du mois
Qui qu'tu sois, j'te calcule pas, t'es qu'une fille du bois
Et si tu m'vois, viens pas m'cer-us pour une session REC
Change de passion et trouve une raison d'être
Le Rap est blindé d'cons, ce n'est pas un jeu saint
Comme les plus sages, je sais donc je suis ingé' son
De Saint-Denis à Godswood, les ien-iens propagent la chose
Respecte mon Rap ou embrasse la chaussée

Je suis le meilleur à tout, j'arrive quand ça craint
Avec des plans malsains, je suis comme l’œil au sommet de la tour
J'attends la fin de l'âge des hommes avec un verre de bourbon
Pendant que mes gobelins brassent des sommes, bouffon
Dès que j'me mets à groover, ça chauffe, je dois
Trouver l'anneau puis te trouer la peau, c'est simple
En fait, j'ai pas le temps de me battre pour la médaille
#Sauron : on met les deux doigts où ça fait mal

Lâche pas des ""t'sais pas d'où j'viens"" quand il faut s'taper
Toi, ça se voit, t'aime trop parler, fais pas d'pub pour ton quartier
On en a rien à foutre, d'ailleurs, on t'flingue la bouche
Quand t'as pas d'soutien
Faut qu'tu comptes que sur tes couilles, bah ouais
C'est bien Mekra, moi, j'suis fahen de pas les voir, qui ça ?
Toutes ces dales-pé qui te tchatchaient, faut pas les croire Mekra
Il faut gratter, il faut taffer, on a des des devoirs Mekra
Comme les languettes de mes Air Max, j'suis jamais droit

J'grignote ta parade, mec, j'vise propre, canarde le Rap
J'ai déballé l'arme, prépare-toi pour le bras d'fer, mignonne
Je m'apprête à t'cravacher, à t'caner, attraper la médaille
Pas de 'blèmes, on fera l'même blasphème à chaque épisode
T'as craqué, la came est salée, j'ai frappé à l'épaule
Napalm et flammes, son carré VIP, c'est ciblé, ça s'échauffe
Entre l'équipe, la maréchaussée, tu parais saucé
Je t'ai dis que ma méthode dégomme à peu de choses près

En matière de Rap, ma team cogne, on mène la vie l'bohème
À Max Do, t'as pas l'profil d'un gars d'Baltimore
Mais on avance où la routine nous mène
On crée des dégâts quand tout Paris dort
J'sais que ça t'effraie, j'rappe comme ça dit, classé vert
On veut faire des ouss, faire notre propre Zénith
Nique la salle des fêtes, vite
Envoie les mandats cash que j'mette bien mes soss
Des billets pleins les poches
Nos vies, un livre de français blindé de fautes

J'ai appris l'""s'il vous plaît"", ""merci"" et j'essaie de m'y soumettre
Mais j'ai des tics, j'doute pour terminer l'exercice
J'fais des petites prouesses
Je t'éclipse même dans mes pires couplets
J'aime chiller avec des minettes à la silhouette très fine
Pendant qu'le bédo suinte
J'me couche tard, j'vais écouter des vinyles
Frère, on peut dire que j'veille au grain
La fête est finie et vos mains sont vides
J'décolle 'vec mes quinze complices
Objectif : empocher nos gains

Re-v'là le singe hurleur maniaque, vu
Toujours obscur et grognon, j'laisse mon ombre occuper vos pions
Loin devant j'opère comme les tueurs d'mafia russe
D'humeur glaciale, j'tue sans aucune émotion
Mais ma vie a un goût de houblon, j'ai un joujou sous l'blouson
Je shoote tout c'qui bouge pour pouvoir être toujours bon
2FingZ prend l'mic, juste des rimes qui t'frappent
Nan, on change pas une équipe qui couche tout l'monde

Paname d'où nous venons, sale gosse du ze-on
Fa2L, oui, salope, j'ai le démon
Solitaire comme dans Léon, je tue d'un coup de crayon
Le crime ne paie pas et pourtant nous nous essayons
J'ai payé mes fautes en cash comptant
Rage profonde car j'y est laissé trop de trace de sang
Y a pas de remèdes, mamen, que des charlatans
Souvent j'compte mes disparus
Et c'est comme ça que j'passe le temps

Rien que ça té-ma comme des poissons-chats, soirée festive
Meskine, j'me vé-squi, on se suit comme l'anaconda
J'observe la traîtrise de leurs racontars et dès seize piges
Ils s'excitent donc je m'exile au près d'mes jav', on bave
On rappe des couplets
Réécrit le futur sur le cadran d'une montre à gousset
J'vais les dégoûter, sûr que j'casse les deux bras
Faut nous écouter, sur la tête à mes deux doigts

J'suis un rescapé de l'époque du fut' sous le boule
S'bute toujours en c'qui concerne d'épater tes potes
Mange ta compote, c'est l'phase-télépathe
Qui revient palper des bords, j'graille toujours
V'là les pâtes et les pâtes mais j'compte bien mette du beurre
Avec les 15 derrière, rien qu'ça lé-vio des veaux-cer
Wesh yo, si t'es chaud, on te laisse un huit barres pour poser
Tire dans toi si t'as l'QI d'une fille en boîte ou d'une cuillère
J'enlèc' les faux car ils représentent c'que j'ai d'pire à leur donner

On parle d'épidémie, c'est inédit, constate qu'on frappe
L'épine est fine mais inévitable, pompe pas les rimes
J'combats les pitres, non à ces types
Pis si l'esprit d'équipe est inestimable, compare les prix
Ça fait des plombes qu'on pompe l'Amérique
Fond marqué dessus, on a l'appétit de l'armée des ombres
On a la technique tarée, j'démonte, lâchez des bombes
Fallait que j'les dombe, ces cons d'valets s'éffondre
Fonflard, atterrir

I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight

They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is goin', I don't know

Tell me, why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

If it ain't 'bout the money, it's ignorin'
I woke up chained up like jigsaw
Outkast, my chain on Big Boy
Make a nigga walk around with a chain guard
I'll hit up your bitch if I get bored
She pressed like I'm puttin' in the PIN wrong
Big guns, if I shoot this bitch wrong, I might break somethin'
Pull it out, put my kids on her tongue, hit her lace front
These hoes be sick in the head, better take somethin'
Walk around with this .40 behind me, like Drake comin'
I give her timeout, she a baddie
She want me to fuck, send the addy
If she want the dick, she can have it
She love me too much, she a addict
The Maybach is Virgil, it's kahki
That ain't no drip, boy, that's tacky
My bitch rippin' Crocs out the plastic
Hoes be thinkin' 'bout me like a caption
Migo gang in this bitch, like what's happenin'?
We the biggest shit out since the Jetsons
Niggas shiesty, so I gotta mask it
I'm a king like the two double mattress
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

Yeah, SET IT OFF 10/13, you know how we comin'
You know what the fuck goin' on
We blowin' the roof off in this motherfucker
Funk, what we doin'?

A story about fairies and colours
Magic and scents, in a secret world
A world of fantasy, where all wishes come true
If you feel the need to dream
Just close your eyes and listen to the Soundlovers once upon a time in a secret world
There was the big reign of a lovely girl
She could be the queen of the universe
But she always dreamed something else
Walking in the wood one day suddenly
She found a magic wand down among the leaves
She said ""Oh my God, will my wish come true?""
Now I really know what to do
Abracadabra magic wand
I wanna be your wonder-girl
Abracadabra magic wand
I wanna fly to see my world
And so one day something amazing happened
So listen on, this is how the story continues...
Once upon a time there's a wonder-girl
Her wish was to fly all around the world
She became the queen of the fantasy
Found her love and lived happily",0.7665982730686665,70.0

)
Why? (
Got that?
)

Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (
Louder
)

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost, but now I am found
I can see that, once, I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey (
Louder
)

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

(We were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Verse 1]
Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

[Verse 2]
More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder
