Ew...
Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue, and Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

Just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby (Just a Holy Fool, woah-oh-oh-oh)

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence
[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence",en,0.5559195717796683,1LY3GhF0zxIVgbYEQjCbUO

Doing my best to hold your heart
And I, I'll never let it go again

So why are you always angry?
Why are you always quiet?
Why do you sleep alone
When I know you don't like it?
Maybe you might be different
Will it kill you to tell me the truth?
What in the Hell does a man
Have to do, to be loved by you?

Well I've been running as fast as I can
And you'll never get over what you can't understand
Pissed off, hanging up the telephone
Forever ain't far, I'm heading home

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?

Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing

You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy, or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man,"" 'cause—

While I'm wasted with someone else?”

Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

[Verse 1]
Ohh!
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Verse 2]
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long

And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
[Bridge 1]
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again

[Bridge 2]
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on

It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

[Chorus 2]
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing

Took him out to Belgium, welcome

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors
[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be
[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""

She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh

Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter
, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire
, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (
Monster
)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
Here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you

Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knock as he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive

[Verse 1]

And whatever you gon' do, just do it
Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contacts full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that Mexican, tryna figure out what my cousin doin'
Prison with the 'migos, found out they was sellin' bricks
Wish I would've knew that shit, I would've been lit
Swear to God, since I was seventeen, I been hood rich
I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York, I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wan' show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lam' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up, but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm buyin' that red Richard Mille
Stay out my lil' brother business, just know that they gettin' millions

Tell the feds get off my dick, I don't gotta buy guns

And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill, I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuyin' cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'm gonna pull up and spray that
Livin' like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like yo mama with the switch ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bro taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill, I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few

Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends

After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one

Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)

Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach

I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper

Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee

Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

Guided by a beating heart

Knows everybody's disapproval

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it

Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty

Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate

Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't

And I know I lose control of the things that I say

When I don't care

Won't wash my hair

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough

Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change
(mmmmmmm)

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

[Chorus]
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)

[Bridge]
The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to sing (sing)
[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

Does she come complete?

Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes

Could never cause me pain

And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

I'm still waiting on you
Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn’t ever have
Maybe we choose the only love
We know we won’t accept
Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For something that is real
’Cause maybe the greatest love of all
Is who the eyes can't see, yeah
[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I’m rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, I call and
I'll take control of you, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours, oh oh
Oh yeah

[Intro]
Yo, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Niggas speak down on my name like I wasn't there for 'em (There for 'em)
Talk about back in the days, this isn't back in the days (Back in the days)
They want me back in my ways, chipped tooth and the fade (Tooth and the fade)

[Verse 1]
Uh, musically I'm on Mars
Walkin' all over the beat, puttin' my feet on the stars
I rock it like Lenny, thinkin' like Jimi the first time he seen a guitar
Standin' in front of where they shot Ahmaud and said we gotta know who we are (Know who we are)
Uh, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Wearin' rare Jordans straight from Air Jordan, this a fair warnin'
Too many young gods beef over nothin'
When you get money, you know that it's comin'
Sayin' they homies, but they ain't a hunnid
We the most hunted, uh
I got my Mets hat on to the back (Back)
Y'all already know where we goin' with the stats (Stats)
Hall of fame only, kings and queens only (Queens only)
They all be grabbin' my style but you know they can't hold me
Yeah, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Y'all still on the ground, you know I've been airborne (I've been airbone)
Studyin' Big, studyin' Nietzsche
You gotta call in a chopper to reach me
Homie, I don't need a jeweler to freeze me
Ice in my veins, I make it look easy
Mentally, I'm in Queens
More money more problems, you gotta be ready for all that it brings
Let 'em say what they say, revenge on my plate, I'm lovin' the taste
They see you shinin', emotions get hard to contain
They just not evolvin' the same (The same)
Me and HB is too rare
I'm movin' all through the snares, sound on billionaire
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm flippin' the page
I'm Prince on the stage, SLAVE on his face
You know what they say, KD the wave
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days  (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
Part II

[Verse 2]
Levels of Tarantino
Curbin' my ego, even though he know
Empty glass of Pinot, cigars and casinos
What they especially praise is the ethos
Stacks on blackjack, movin' my chips
No superstition to make me get rich
I'm with this chick, just one I brought today
In between placin' my bets, we shopped at Cartier
Rose gold I copped her a set
Runway hopped in the jet, flight attendant poppin' Moet
I said I need that Dom, off of respect
We havin' conversations, niggas show me property then
I call my nigga Ant, I told him, ""Yo, I gotta be there""
Salmon shish kebab, in a misty fog, rollin' sticky log
Big dawg affair, no kids involved
Roundtable havin' war council
Press one button, it'll change the world around you
Too rare, nothin' to see here, Cuban over my streetwear
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you just to be fair
It's okay to keep the mystique, I learned that in the street
On me, solo or deep, I'm puttin' on for the G's

Part III
[Verse 3]
(Hit-Boy)
We been doin' gangsta shit for a long time
Look inside my mind, see a gold mine
I'm my own cosign, she textin' the old line
You keep starin' at the glow, bitch, don't go blind
Braveheart energy, fuck all of the enemies
XO Hennessy, it's not on me, it's in me
I'm not here to be friendly, they ain't even contendin'

[Verse 1: Jung Kook, Jimin]
어느 날 세상이 멈췄어
아무런 예고도 하나 없이
봄은 기다림을 몰라서
눈치 없이 와버렸어
발자국이 지워진 거리
여기 넘어져있는 나
혼자 가네 시간이
미안해 말도 없이, yeah

[Verse 2: RM]
오늘도 비가 내릴 것 같아
흠뻑 젖어버렸네
아직도 멈추질 않아
저 먹구름보다 빨리 달려가
그럼 될 줄 알았는데
나 겨우 사람인가 봐
몹시 아프네
세상이란 놈이 준 감기
덕분에 눌러보는 먼지 쌓인 되감기
넘어진 채 청하는 엇박자의 춤
겨울이 오면 내쉬자
더 뜨거운 숨
[Pre-Chorus: V, Jung Kook]
끝이 보이지 않아
출구가 있긴 할까?
발이 떼지질 않아 않아, oh
잠시 두 눈을 감아
여기 내 손을 잡아
저 미래로 달아나자

[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jimin]
Like an echo in the forest
하루가 돌아오겠지
아무 일도 없단 듯이
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
또 하루 더 날아가지
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again

[Verse 3: SUGA]
이 음악을 빌려 너에게 나 전할게 (Ayy)
사람들은 말해 세상이 다 변했대 (No)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
다행히도 우리 사이는
아직 여태 안 변했네
[Verse 4: j-hope, Jung Kook]
늘 하던 시작과 끝 ""안녕"" 이란 말로
오늘과 내일을 또 함께 이어보자고 (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-woah)
멈춰있지만 어둠에 숨지 마
빛은 또 떠오르니깐

[Pre-Chorus: V, V & Jung Kook, Jin]

触れる拳に流れる波紋　DIOの体が
崩れそうだぞ
二人で一人奇妙な友情すら感じている（ジョジョー!）

黄金の精神　流れる血筋に
思いつく限り惨たらしい死を
昇る太陽に消えて死ぬ前に
くらえロードローラーだ（ロードローラーだッ！）
時を止めてみても（ザ・ワールドッ）
目潰しをしても（この血の目潰しはッ！）
貴様のスタンドが動けるなら
意味は無いな　空に日が昇るまで
持ち堪えるぞ

（人間は誰でも不安や恐怖を克服して安心を得るために生きる）
（名声を手に入れたり　人を支配したり）
（安心を求める事こそ人間の目的だ）

ジョジョにしかできない
このDIOの体の代わりなんて（馴染む！実に馴染むぞ）
向かってくるのか　よかろう
近づくがよい
次は承太郎
（貴様だ）
同じタイプの能力
ジョナサンの血筋　受け継いだせいか
このままラッシュの速さ比べて
このDIOが勝つしかないぞ
それでもきっとこのDIOきっと
発動「世界」　 時を止めたぞ
10秒経過

（おれは「恐怖」を克服することが）
（「生きる」ことだと思う）
（世界の頂点に立つ者は）
（ほんのちっぽけな「恐怖」をも持たぬ者ッ！）
（わかるかエンヤ婆？）

無駄無駄オラオラぶつかり合って
がむしゃらに投げ出したDIOの脚を砕く貴様
無駄無駄無駄無駄放つ拳
本当はもう気付いてるんだ

あーほらまた「星の白金」（オラッ!）
オラオラ食らう何度だってさ（捉えたっ!）
食らうラッシュでそろそろこのDIOの
体にヒビが入ってしまったぞ
不死身であるはずのDIOが
DIOは初めて恐れた

黄金の精神　流れる血筋に
このDIOの野望は打ち砕かれる
昇る太陽に溶けてゆくように
体が徐々に消えてく
搾り取ってやる　きさまの生命を
『浄めてやる　その穢れたる野望』
消えるDIOを眺める承太郎
ジョジョの面影重ねる
殺してしまいたくて憎んでたジョジョに
感じているこの奇妙な友情と
二人だけの数奇なこの運命は
朝日と共に
震える心臓の鼓動が（震えるぞ）
このDIOは
ジョジョに　敗北する

半天上的秃鹰那张脸
半生中的记忆在盘旋
第五十三天后的日夜线
等黑夜问白天
能不能赦免 灰色的人间
别交换吧日夜
冰封的眼泪 一滴就很咸
来自暮光的 明信片
它无声无色无言
翻过山巅跟我扮鬼脸
但黑夜恨白天
拼命的往前 听不到救援
命运太疯癫 每一眨眼 都很玄
那对逆光中的黑雁
也飞过去老远
等再见不如说一次再见 挑一天
皮肤之下的瘀青渗着血
细胞之中的绝望在喊冤
被五十三天的孤单抽一鞭
等黑夜问白天
能不能赦免 灰色的人间
别交换吧日夜
冰封的眼泪 一滴就很咸
来自暮光的 明信片
它无声无色无言
翻过山巅跟我扮鬼脸
喊黑夜吻白天
谢谢了时间 弄红了双眼
往事的光圈 每一瞬间 都很绝
那跑过去的昼夜 是孤独的修炼
说再见不如忘掉能再见
在半空中真好 不会吵 人少
却看得到那些近在天边的风暴
黑夜吻白天
谢谢了时间 弄红了双眼
往事的光圈 每一瞬间 都很绝
那跑过去的昼夜 是孤独的修炼
说再见不如忘掉能再见
今天

It's Christmas Eve

[Verse 1: Han, Changbin, Hyunjin, Seungmin]
밤새 내린 눈은 잠깐만 예뻐
낭만은 개뿔
눈치 없는 차들 땜에 금방 새까매진 거 봐
걷기도 빡세 눈밭보단 갯벌
무릎까지 다 젖은 바지
조금 걷다가 나자빠짐
특별한 날 특별하길
변질됐지 별일 없길
뒹굴뒹굴 뒹굴다 눈덩이만 부었지
어제 만든 눈사람은 멀쩡하려나
아 따가 부러
칼바람에 베여 칭칭
Brrr, 떨리는 목소리
컬러풀은 무슨 풀 하나 안 보여
랩하다 콜록콜록콜록 기침
[Pre-Chorus: Lee Know, I.N]
Jack Frost coming for y'all, run, run
뼈까지 시리게 하는 holiday, silence

추위만 거세져 장작 대신 애가 탄다
미끄런 길 덕에 차는 더 막혀 땡큐다 겨울아
입김이 나오고 빨개진 코 겹겹이 껴입은 곳만 덥고
뭐가 부끄러워서, ayy, 귀 따갑도록 빨개졌네
뽀샤시는 무슨 눈에 김 꼈다 나름 퀄리티 굿 필터 (Oh)
오 피해가 피해가 폭설 맞은 패딩을 짜내면 오리터
추우면 춥다고 붙는 쟤네 땜에 눈꼴도 시려 (Yo)

Si estás con alguien pienso a cada rato
Y no son celos, ponte en mis zapatos

Bientôt, j'irai au ciel rejoindre Rimkus, le p'tit Lamine

On a toujours fait que du sale et nos parents ne font que prier
Pardonne-moi si j'suis pas là, c'est qu'je cours derrière les milliers
J'suis avec Savastano dans un quatre étoiles en Crête
Pas très loin de Malia, elle est chargée sous le maillot
Le nez dans mes affaires, bébé, m'attends pas pour le dîner
Et si c'est trop bizarre, bah, j'disparaîtrais comme Houdini
Vaillant comme Souleymane, vaillant comme Mekness et di-Meh
À deux doigts d'péter l'million, mais ce pédé s'fait désirer
Pour l'instant, j'suis dans le hall, sous doré, j'réfléchis
Qui aura l'sourire en coin d'bouche si je flanche ?
Ceux qui parlent fort sont que des baltringues déguisées
J'ai les chaussures qui piquent, j'arrive vers les Champs-Élysées
On peut t'enlever la vie pour sauver nos réputations
Évitons toutes les tentations, à l'heure qu'il est, j'suis dans l'avion

Y a la volaille qui rapplique, on s'échappe

Et pour avoir cette vie-là, j'ai remonté les bretelles
Quand le rêve est trop long, le réveil est brutal
Black Panther, comme la daronne de 2Pac
Les barreaux ou les tropiques, on prendra l'argent d'tout-par
Et de toute façon, c'est nous les bests, en vrai
Dis-leur qu'ils restent tranquilles ou le machin va discuter

이길 수 없던 fighting, bleeding, losing 이젠 지쳤어
가질 수 없다면 I fuckin' keep it low

Love you, love you, love you no matter what I do

전쟁 같은 life 지기만 했었던 나
넌 내 구원이었어 (No doubt, no doubt, no doubt)
벼랑 끝에서 너의 빛이 나를 이끌어
Making me a winner (So right, so right, so right)

밑바닥에서 crawling, fighting, bleeding 이젠 지쳤어
거절하겠다면 I fuckin' take it all
Crying, crying, crying 이젠 집어쳐
Love you, love you, love you, no matter what I do

I say run

안간힘 써봐도 추락해
너와 함께라면 (너와 함께라면)
추락도 아름다워
하늘의 반대편으로
기꺼이 나 가라앉아
그저 서로를 안아줬으면 해

모두가 날 비웃어도 I don't care
가라앉고 싶어 너의 바다에

Lovesick girls
Lovesick girls

[Verse 1: Jennie, All]
영원한 밤
창문 없는 방에 우릴 가둔 love (Love)
What can we say?
매번 아파도 외치는 love (Love)

[Verse 2: Lisa]
다치고 망가져도 나
뭘 믿고 버티는 거야
어차피 떠나면 상처투성인
채로 미워하게 될걸
끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어
이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo, Rosé]
아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
But I don't care, I'll do it over and over
내 세상 속엔 너만 있으면 돼
[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Post-Chorus: All]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

[Verse 3: Lisa, Jennie]
No love letters, no X and O's
No love, never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone
Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo]
아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
불안한 내 눈빛 속에 널 담아
아프더라도 너만 있으면 돼
[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Post-Chorus: All]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

[Bridge: Rosé, Jisoo]
사랑은 slippin' and fallin'
사랑은 killin' your darlin'
아프다 아물면 또 찾아오는 이 겁 없는 떨림
들리지 않아 what you say
이 아픔이 난 행복해
나를 불쌍해 하는 네가 내 눈엔 더 불쌍해

[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

現實中對的錯的不要提起
現在你是我女主角演齣戲

我悄悄帶你看 無人夜深多精彩
那載滿仁義道德的腦袋
是否都應該要帶點愛

任他怎講只要與你持續熱吻
要放冷槍 要炮轟
我們就更愛
誰又不忿 Yeah-yeah

彈指之間釋放我這狂熱內心
情形如夜色找到街燈

讓我的愛惹起公憤

用一雙手擁抱更可愛

[Intro]
Cierra los ojos (Cierra los ojos)
Deja flotar tu imaginación (Deja flotar tu imaginación)
¡Imagina! (Imagina)
La felicidad no la da una tarjeta Visa
Que tus sueños e ilusiones se van si vives con prisa
Se agotan al compás de cada nota como el tiempo
Que tu corazón se rompe y se mueren tus sentimientos


[Verso 1]
Imagina que puedes rebobinar al pasado
Dar marcha atrás, borrar cada error, cada paso mal dado
Y créeme que más de una vez lo he intentado (Sí)
El tiempo es lo más valioso, pero lo desperdiciamos
Y yo observo el infinito y se desvanece en mis manos
Pienso que es normal que la caguemos si somos humanos
Imagina que todos damos todo sin pedir a cambio nada
Que toda historia acaba como en cuentos de hadas
La vida nos moldea dando palos (Oh)
El amor es el mayor error y lo mejor que te ha pasado
Imagina por un momento una vida sin dolor
Sin sufrimiento, convierte a tu aburrimiento en humor
La vida no es una mierda, los mierdas son las personas
Mientras unas te apuñalan y las otras te traicionan
Imagina que no fuera así por un instante
Que lo que a ti menos te importa fuera los más importante
Imagina que conoces las respuestas de todas tus preguntas
Que ganas toda puesta y que toda gente se junta
Sin hacer distinciones de ningún tipo
Que lo superficial fuera lo menos bonito
[Estribillo]
Imagina, sueña, odia la realidad
Ojos que no ven, corazón que siente felicidad
Cierra los ojos, vuela con este rap (Rap)
Sueña que imaginas un mundo sin una pizca de maldad
Imagina, sueña, odia la realidad
Ojos que no ven, corazón que siente felicidad
Cierra los ojos, vuela con este rap (Rap)
Sueña que imaginas un mundo sin una pizca de maldad

[Verso 2]
Imagina que Dios existe y que te escucha
Que su silencio deja de escucharse cuando por lo que más quieres luchas
Muchos son los llamados, pocos los elegidos
Que jamás se ha marchado uno de tus seres queridos
Lucha por lo que quieres
Imagina que nadie puede robarte jamás lo que tienes, pues te pertenece
Cada uno tendrá lo que se merece
Aquí conseguirás cerrar toda cicatriz, ser realmente feliz
Un sinfín de emociones, saborear la eterna juventud
La sensación es no tener miedo de un ataúd (No)
La oscuridad nace al esconderse la luz
La salvación nos extinguió cuando a Jesús lo clavaron en la cruz
Aquí la gente no miente, sincera
Decide si quieres estar en otoño, verano, invierno o primavera
Tú verás de qué manera ocurrirá cada suceso
Los golpes serán sustituidos por los besos
Tú eres el dueño de tu destino (Sí)
Aquí no existen violadores, pederastas, terroristas ni asesinos
Ni ningún mal hacia la humanidad
Imaginad ese lugar donde está la eterna felicidad (Y es que)
Aquí no hay leyes porque no se necesitan
Que cuando quieras tus mejores momentos se repitan
Como en un videojuego tener vidas infinitas
Y que das la vuelta al mundo, mundo que ya no te irrita
Imagínalo, imagina el no tener que estar en soledad
Que dices lo que piensas de verdad, nadie te puede silenciar aquí
Haces más que pensar en ti
Sueño con decir que no es necesario el éxtasis
Pa' flotar, volar bien lejos sin que corten tus alas
No sería necesario atravesarlas si no existieran las balas
Sin medida del tiempo no te harás viejo
Y mi canción imagina que es producto de tu imaginación
[Estribillo]
Imagina, sueña, odia la realidad
Ojos que no ven, corazón que siente felicidad

We may be torn apart

Afraid of my dentist, so my teeth are fallin' out

Fight or flight switch on when it broke
An uneasy punchline, a horrible joke
The fictional frontline to which I've been drafted
Will bend to my will if it ever should happen
But wartime cares not for joy of existing
I can't help but wonder the world I am missing

I am terrified of what I have become
Comfortably dumb, endearing to some

Peddling scares in the place of a pass time
But I'm just a lily disguised as a landmine
For short bursts of time, I puff out my chest, but
My asthma requires me to take baby breaths
The closest connections, transmissions in code
And I miss my memaw when I'm on the road
I'm oddly obsessed with being depressed
I'd heal if I wanted, but likely remain a mess

Uh, 现实已变成游戏
最美的人在梦里
但其实当梦醒过后
它已不成立

时常等待着天空星星的聚集
这也许是给我希望的理由
想拥有像超人一样的超能力
不被任何人欺负但是其实
其实
现实很残酷也很丑陋
一切都不是在做梦
隐藏真实自己
哪儿你都要带上面具生活
为生存吗
为什么要做给别人看
人生就只有这一次不是吗
未来等我们寻找呢
不留遗憾的闭上眼睛告别世界
[副歌 (Chorus)]
Oh, 我从不会怕
跌倒那一刹那
雨后我相信一定会出现彩霞
Oh, 梦里的童话
只有在那里我才可以
拥有那真实美好的世界

[第二句 (Verse 2)]
过去那些往事都如过往云烟
吹一下就飘走的那些故事
身边的每个人都要好好珍惜
Okay, get up and listen
因为不知何时会离开你, let's go
心中燃烧过后的凄凉
无法再蓄火时的那种失望
在你的世界 你是否有过
这种感觉 告诉我
Oh, 我无法诉说
我想表达的 所有感觉
Oh, 因为在这条路上
我只可以保持沉默
I have no way

现在我不再自己承受所有的声音
面对外界次次的打击
有你们在身边陪我
That’s better (that's better)
最幸福的事情那
请听好无能为力也要鼓起勇气
克服解决所有的问题 (let's make it better, everybody together)

[第二过渡的乐句 (Bridge 2)]
现在我们一起走出谷底
Uh uh平静下来感受时间那么的慢
每天遗失掉的时间却看不见
到底谁成为我回忆
被迫去选择 磨灭了我的记忆
So 沉默 反省吧
谁都有年少轻狂的时候吧
谁不是从年轻慢慢变成熟的呢
我去的地方
门永远为我敞开

Oh, 我从不会怕 跌倒那一刹那 (Don't worry about me)
雨后我相信一定会出现彩霞 (I'm gonna be free)

Something about the summer
I didn't cope with well

In the same spot, tripped and fell
And I check my spit for blood
And I do not call enough
I spill my guts for money
But you don't find my jokes that funny

There's something in the tone of my voice
That makes you question everything I say
And I will never learn to just shut my mouth
And bury things our parents' way
And you said that I should quit what I fear
And I know I just wanted it to be my idea
And you said that I do not exist
And I know at least now we agree on it

That I'm not just here for everyone else
Make plans for birthdays
That I don't care if I celebrate
And I'm sorry that I can't be

But I do not reach out enough
But I'm reaching up

[Intro]
¡Yeah!
He cambiado
Hemos cambiado

[Verso 1: Shinoflow & Porta]
¿Habré cambiado tanto? ¿Me habré vuelto más tonto?
¿Tendré algo de razón si llego tarde y aún es pronto?
¿Habré volado más alto que los pájaros?
¿Habré toca'o el sol? ¿Me habré quema'o y habré bajado?
¿Si he cambiado? Mírame a los ojos y descúbrelo
Tu velocidad se habrá parado por algún reloj
Pues veo que no reconoces
El roce de mi corazón latiendo en altavoces
Sube el bombo, tu eres un bombón y yo era un monstruo
Y yo en tu rostro vi los restos de la brisa del agosto
Y parece que fue ayer, pero será mañana, ¿no te jode?
Tenemos poco tiempo pa' que encima nos lo roben
Quiero marcharme en un Land Rover hasta el monte
Donde note el norte sobre el corte de horizonte
Sí, que se vuelvan verticales
Shinoflow, el presidente de los estados mentales
Prefiero morir soñando a morir despierto
Dormir en un desierto de palabras donde el agua es el silencio
Que mi corazón reclama
¿Cuántas de las que llevo a la cama valoran mas el alma que mi fama?
No se, yo soy el mismo con corbata
El acróbata de ritmos, te lo explico hasta en pijama
Pijo, pídele a mamá mi disco
Que no te va de sol si veraneas en San Francisco (¡Yeah!)
[Estribillo: Shinoflow]
No he cambiado como tu quisieras primo
Cambié lo suficiente sin salirme del camino
No he cambiado ni la mitad que el resto
Pero he cambiado el doble que vosotros, por supuesto
No he cambiado como tu quisieras primo
Cambié lo suficiente sin salirme del camino
No he cambiado ni la mitad que el resto
Pero he cambiado el doble que vosotros, por supuesto

[Verso 2: Porta]
Que he cambiado, traigo combo, ¿cómo?, mi rap mejorado
Claro grabo con— y voy subiendo los peldaños
Años pasan y el rap en España sigue igual de sectario
Hay cambios de mal en peor, no soy un rapero de barrio
Es necesario aprenderse el abecedario en la EGB
Mi vocabulario va mas allá y eso que no hacía los deberes
Ya no juego al Mario Bros (No), ahora hago rap a diario (Sí)
De año sabático estoy, tacho días del calendario
Este es mi código binario, los cambios son experiencia
Varias ganas de avanzar, evolución y consistencia
Esfuerzo, trabajo y paciencia es lo que hacen de mi un MC
Cambiar para bien o pa' mal solo dependerá de ti
No dejes que te manejen como un títere
Me enteré de que dependes del que solo te quiere por interés
No es que te pusiste a fumar y a beber por ordenes
De quienes te hieren y tan solo quieren su bien
Rectificar es de sabios, cambiar pa' mal es de tontos
Por un camino puedes quedarte solo y perderlo todo
Y tendrás que empezar de cero, así que es simple, sé tu mismo
Cambias como el tiempo al tempo del ritmo en este sonido
Tu forma de ser se forma por norma, tu estilo cambia
El reloj no se para y nos separa de la rutina más rutinaria
¿Qué harías tú si ahora todos cambian contigo? (Ay)
Piensa, actúa y no dejes que influencias te lleven por el mal camino (No)
Si lo haces, luego no te reconocen
Tu conciencia hace cruces de cables, ni tú te conoces
Salir con gente nueva o distinta de otra forma funciona
Se fiel a tus principios, no cambies, evoluciona
[Estribillo: Shinoflow]
No he cambiado como tu quisieras primo
Cambié lo suficiente sin salirme del camino
No he cambiado ni la mitad que el resto
Pero he cambiado el doble que vosotros, por supuesto
No he cambiado como tu quisieras primo
Cambié lo suficiente sin salirme del camino
No he cambiado ni la mitad que el resto
Pero he cambiado el doble que vosotros, por supuesto

[Verso 3: El Cansino]
Aunque cada día estoy más chungo de lo mío
No me faltan las ideas ni las ganas, mira (¿Vale?)
Pongo sorna en cada línea por placer, volví a nacer
Me hice las paces y cambie mi cara plana por sonrisas socarronas
Así sin más, la suma del total es cero
Mantengo el equilibrio, muchos se picaron
Yo aguanté el tirón, soy pícaro, ¿cuestión de potra?
No lo creo, como Casparov prefiero estarme quieto
Antes que dar pasos pa' atrás de mal agüero
Pero pájaro de todas maneras, vuelo libre
Más vigilo tras mis posaderas, que después de esta escalera
No puede haber nada bueno, que será, será
Demonio en cuerpo de pantera, imposible seguir sereno
Alteras mi temperatura, víctima del desenfreno y sano
Pierdo la cordura, pero la encuentro tarde o temprano
Y vuelvo pa' seguir siendo el mismo fulano
[Estribillo: Shinoflow]
No he cambiado como tu quisieras primo
Cambié lo suficiente sin salirme del camino
No he cambiado ni la mitad que el resto
Pero he cambiado el doble que vosotros, por supuesto
No he cambiado como tu quisieras primo
Cambié lo suficiente sin salirme del camino
No he cambiado ni la mitad que el resto
Pero he cambiado el doble que vosotros, por supuesto

[Outro: Shinoflow & Porta]
Yeah
Todos hemos cambiado después de leer el Evangelio de Judas
Boquillo, ¿qué es eso del Evangelio de Judas?
No, no, hombre, hombre
Ya, ya
Que este es un tema muy serio, este es un tema muy serio y hay que decir algo que la peña lo escuche y se conmueva (Uh)
O sea, no puedes decir—
Ya, ya, ¿qué es esto?

Gasp your vomit out
You'll never reach the shore
Defigured like a scrag

Unfathomable cursed
Perpetuate my memories
Incombustible words
Heinous and destructive
Balanced on the edge
Rancerously cutting
He's dangerous and sledge

And street corner talking
To call my people to action

Tills skolan blev en väg jag inte orka' gå
Om jag fortsätter skolka kanske tårar torkar
Och hade självmordstankar innan jag var 12 år
Men då jag gömde smärtan inombords
Den exploderade år senare på nån citykrog
Skolan, mannen, varför gå den?
När rasten var en scen från Clockwork Orange
Välkommen till mina områden!
Där livsglädjen är det första som fuckin' dör på en
Och de var fyra-fem mot en
Vi beslöt byta skolan efter 4:an, min vän
Misshandlad i skogen vid skolan

En bit av min själ dog, empatin raderades
In och ut på barnpsykiatrin, det planterades
Det var något fel på mig

Och jag tänkte ""Pass på livet"", jag leker ensam varje rast
Och en trogen bästa vän då, var nåt jag aldrig haft
Dom jaga mig och mamma, vi fick springa för vårt liv
Och pappa ut och vevade med baseballträn och skit
Torka dina kinder för gott, slut på tårarna

Vid rätt tidpunkt och den orsakar en orkan

Hade han e dröm & en tom hand
Ingen gav honom en chans
Men han gjorde drömmen sann
Han satte segel på båten
När vi gick på drog han den loss
Vi sov under stjärnhimlen
Tills solen väckte oss

Tag min hand, du tände min eld
Tag min hand, du tände min eld
Pappa tag min hand
Du gjorde drömmen sann

Min mamma växte upp
På restauranger & hotell
Hon gav mig sin gitarr
Och jag minns att hon sa en kväll:
Gör som du vill men bli aldrig musiker
Du blir slav under buteljen
Jag har sett så mycket elände
Hör du vad jag säger
Tag min hand, du tände min eld
Tag min hand, du tände min eld
Vad är rätt om ingen gör fel
Mamma gråt inte mer

Jimmy & Jazzgossen bodde i huset mitt emot
Upp på taken, upp på vindarna
Ner igen, fulla av sot
Bakgårdsprinsar & prinsessor
På gatorna gick kungarna
Under gatlyktorna stod dom otrogna
Och dom vassa tungorna
Zigenar-Jacko, bodde i ett par svarta stövlar
Svart kostym, vit skjorta
När han kom sa vi:
Här kommer söndag
Folk sa att han kom från skogen
Bergen & de vilda hästarna
Han tog vem som helst med knogarna
Även polisen och prästerna

Tag min hand, du tände min eld
Tag min hand, du tände min eld
Jacko tag min hand
Varenda gata bär ditt namn
Annie född av Carmen
Tog emot oss på sitt rum
Vi gav henne våra hjärtan
Hon tog dem tum för tum
Franska kyssar i karusellen
Jag hade jobb, jag hade pengarna
Det var en tid av förväntningar...
Karusellkvällarna

Tag min hand, du tände min eld
Tag min hand, du tände min eld
Annie vad hände sen
Vi slängdes ur en flygmaskin om natten
Vi satt i en livbåt på ett stort svart vatten

Jag tar dagen som den kommer nu
Jag lär mej att gå igen
Jag lägger varje korn av sanden på vågen
Nån har gett det som en gåva till mej
Floden faller ner i havet
Bergen sträcker sig mot molnen

Kva er grunnen her, hæ?
Kvifor held du att for slik ein mann?

Er det fordi han vaggar kring?
Eller bollen hans er pling?
Eller storetåa hans står heilt på snei
Sjøl om vi veit han vaskar smuss, så luktar han litt rart å pusi
Men du møter aldri nokon like sensitiv og grei

Så gutten treng å bli fiksa opp litt
Da han har ein del feil
Fordi er han en klein fyr
Er kompis med reinsdyr
Også er han iblandt en smule stein
Så gutten treng å bli fiksa opp litt, men vi veit utan tvil
Du kan fikse heile guten opp med kjærleik og eit smil

(Kan vi bare slutte å snakke om dette?
Vi har et helt ordentlig problem her)
Jaaavisst, så sei meg kjære
Er det fordi at han er redd
Og sosialt litt ute av ledd
Og at han lagar gule grimmar hus bak deg
Kva?
Veit du ikkje vil bli såra fordi han er bleik i håra
Og fordi han skjuler at han er av dynagjer

Så guten treng å bli fiksa opp litt
Han er jo kar eller venn
Han isolerer og ignorerer sjøl det er deilig å bo på motsatt hjem
Så guten treng å bli fiksa opp litt
Og her kjem første steg
Er ingenting slik som fiksa guten er fiksa opp igjen

Hun er forlovet med en annen fyr, okei?)

Da må ho og bli fiksa opp litt
Betyr ingenting

Og eg har sett ho har ingen ring!
Så jenta treng å bli fiksa opp litt
Ho verkar utilpass
Sett denna karen helt ute av spel så er alle ting på plass

Han blir kanskje ikkje annleis for det er hans eigen vei
Men vi veit kjærleiken er ei kraft, forunderlig og sterk
Alle dommer hva blir gjort i stillhet, frykt og stress
Men lever alle i kjærleiken (lever alle i kjærleiken)
Er ditt liv som fest, då er ditt liv som fest

On s'reverra peut-être dans l'autre monde

[Couplet 1 : Bigflo]
Mourir, on sait comment faire, c'еst une chose qu'on peut faire seul
Et si demain on m'enterre, mettez un micro dans le cercueil
Il est 9h59, la mort frappe à 10 heures
Je préfère l'enfer avec mes proches, que le paradis seul
On est plongés et on baigne tous dans la foule
Le ciel sait que l'on saigne sous nos cagoules
Les grains qui tombent dans le sablier nous rappellent que le temps est limité
La mort et la main d'une mère : les deux seules choses qu'on ne peut éviter
Ceux qui l'ont côtoyée de près sont dans l'aigreur
Certains essayent de l'esquiver, c'est une erreur
On essaye tous de l'oublier, ça nous fait peur
Mais la Casio et la Rolex donnent la même heure
Ne me donnez pas de morphine, je préfère vivre et souffrir
On meurt avec les poches vides mais la tête, elle, est pleine de souvenirs
Ne t'en fais pas tu sais, une fois arrivé au bout
On vit toujours un peu dans l'esprit de ceux qui se souviennent de nous

J'ai pas l'cœur brisé bébé, j'ai l'cœur d'un enfant soldat
La mort rode chez nous, les pompes funèbres font du sold-out (wow)
J'ai assisté à plus d'enterrements que d'mariages
Car l'premier est une certitude, le deuxième est un choix
J'ai pleuré quand mon frère est mort, ça j'peux t'l'avouer
Obligé d'consoler ma mère avec la gorge nouée (hey)
Ils pensent tous que je n'ai pas de cœur parce que j'suis cagoulé (hey)
J'remercie Dieu à chaque circonstance, que Dieu soit loué
Très jeune, j'ai vu des gens mourir, surtout au Congo
Le cimetière est le seul endroit où nous sommes tous égaux
J'viens d'là où pour un manque de respect, tu repars les pieds d'vant (gang)
La mort n'arrête pas l'amour mais aimons-nous vivants (wow)
J'crois en Dieu, j'ai la foi, ta peine, je la vois, face à la mort, personne ne fait le poids
Ils m'regretteront comme Johnny, Balavoine, dans ma tristesse, dans mon chagrin, je me noie
On perd des proches et on y pense sans arrêt
Que Dieu nous bénisse et nous donne plus de sœurs comme Assa Traoré (du love)

Pas de regret si mon heure sonne (non), les idées claires si je sombre

Dis-moi, tu penses à quoi quand ton âme dépasse les montagnes ?
Sûrement le seul endroit où j'veux pas qu'mon frère m'accompagne (Bigflo)
Elle n'a jamais tort, quand tu penses la perdre, elle gagne
La mort sera la plus belle de toutes mes punchlines
Elle me tourne autour, j'me méfie d'elle, comme Kalash, la mort est criminelle (yeah)
Tu peux voir la peur dans mes prunelles, je ferai demi-tour si j'aperçois le bout du tunnel
En attendant, je veux être meilleur qu'hier, ramène mes disques d'or dans l'cimetière
J'ai pas lâché tous mes pleurs ni mes ""Je t'aime"", le destin m'a fait une fleur, pas de chrysanthème
[Pont : Oli]
J'm'effacerai évidemment (évidemment)
Le jour où je dépasserai le firmament (firmament)
Quelques rimes sur le papier du testament (du testament)

I never would have got through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a-ridin' on the Tennessee Stud
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Bud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun, and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud
One day I was riding in a beautiful land
I run smack into an Indian band
They jumped their nags with a whoop and a yell
And away we rode like a bat out of hell
I circled their camp for a time or two
Just to show what a Tennessee horse can do
The redskin boys couldn't get my blood
'Cause I was a-riding on the Tennessee Stud
We drifted on down into no man's land
We crossed that river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with the Spaniard's foal
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and a gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee Stud

I got just as lonesome as a man can be
Dreamin' of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue
'Cause he was a-dreamin' of a sweetheart, too

We loped right back across Arkansas;
I whupped her brother and I whupped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was a-riding on the Tennessee Mare

Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy, then we forded the flood
On the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud

Fine att du kickar och så
Men åtminstone ring din familj då och då
Jag vet vad du gör när du försvinner och så (Kom igen asså)
Det kommer sluta med att du sitter inne nåt år
Mannen, det var med dig som jag började blaze
Det var du som drog med mig på bax
Sen du blev farsa, duktig, stila upp dig
Nu du ska komma och va lack
Och snacka om att jag borde ändra mina vanor
Hemma det var jobbigt, men du flyttade snabbt
Jag, morsan och Joel bodde kvar, bror
Vart var ens du? Man såg dig knappt
Jag förstår dig exakt men
Vad vet du om att behöva jobba dag och natt för att hämta till ditt matbord?
Jag var bara nitton år och hade redan barn bror, mycket ansvar, bror
Det är därför jag stack
Jobba två skift och hemma det var baby mama drama
Skrikit och bråkigt, så lite man sovit
Jag svär att jag ville finnas där för dig, bror
Men det är svårt när man själv mådde dåligt
Dåligt, vad vet du om dåligt?
Razzia och skulder, vad vet du om sånt?
Socialen ville ta vårdnaden om mina barn
Det var knas, men vad vet du om sånt? (Svär?)
Ja
Varför har du inte sagt nånting? Det här var ingenting jag visste om
Fan ska jag säga? Jag är din storebror
Ska jag tynga dig med min sorg? Ah

Sho, brori
Ah, vad händer?
Svär, jag ska inte ljuga
Jag är lite orolig
Fick ett samtal av mori, hon sa aina varit där igår och de hitta massa skit i ditt rum
Det var bara lite weed, det är lugnt
Varför har du mängder hemma ens, mannen, är du dum?
Matter of fact, skulle inte du skaffa jobb?
Ska du vara deli som jag när jag var ung?
Driver du? Medans ni härjar på spelning
Jag var kvar i allt knas
Mori full i rummet här bredvid fari duckade sitt ansvar (Jag vet bror)
Jag såg upp till er och det vet ni
Lyssna alltid på vad ni sa
Gjorde även allt som ni gjort
Så ärligt talat, bror (Ah hah?), du vet att det var (Vadå?)
Tack vare dig som jag började blaze
Sen barn alltid sett era röka hasch
Sen gick du och blev känd, började resa hela landet
Fan, inte jag, jag var kvar i min trakt
Slängde weed i vår trapp (Bror)
Huh, tiden går snabbt
Jag får din stasha din gun när du åkte fast
Eller cutta din växt och lägga i plast

Después que te vi la otra noche
Después de que te vi bailar
Me acosté pensando en tus ojos
Soñé lo más bello que pude soñar
Nos vimos solo un par de veces
Y entraste en mis sueños igual
No sé lo que piensas de esto
Yo siento que comienzo a enamorarme de ti
Me endulzas cuando hablas
Me muero si te hago reír, es así
Tu modo me mata
Te quiero invitar a salir

Déjame intentar conquistarte
Pasemos un rato, cenemos, vamos a caminar
Podríamos llevarnos bien
[Verso 2]
No sé cómo haré para hablarte
Le he preguntado a mi amiga por ti
Me dijo que estabas saliendo
Hace poco tiempo con alguien
Recuerdo cuando lo nombraste
Recuerdo que hablaste de él
Si aún no te has enamorado
Quizás sea momento de probarme a mí, ven aquí
Yo quiero que sepas que eres la más bella mujer
Que yo vi, juguemos un poco juntos
¿No ves mis ojos brillando por ti?

Te llamaría nervioso por esta ilusión de tenerte
Tu pelo, tus manos, tu forma de hablar
Tus dientes y tu sonrisa, la ropa que usas

Quisiera ver más
En un rincón de mi cuerpo he guardado
Millones de besos que saltan, que quieren salir

I'd rather break bread with Dawkins
Than Desmond Tutu, to be honest

To the commercialisation of an ancient religion
To the westernisation of a dead Palestinian
Press-ganged into selling PlayStations and beer

Though I'm not expecting
A visit from Jesus

I'll be seeing my dad
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum

It means they're worthy

I get freaked out by churches
Some of the hymns that they sing have nice chords
But the lyrics are dodgy

And yes, I have all of the usual objections
To the miseducation
Of children who, in tax-exempt institutions
Are taught to externalise blame
And to feel ashamed
And to judge things as plain right and wrong
But I quite like the songs

I'm not expecting big presents
The old combination of socks, jocks and chocolates
Is just fine by me

Cause I'll be seeing my dad
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun
I'll be seeing my dad
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun

My jetlagged infant daughter
You'll be handed round the room
Like a puppy at a primary school
And you won't understand
But you will learn someday
That wherever you are and whatever you face
These are the people who'll make you feel safe
In this world
My sweet blue-eyed girl

And if my baby girl
When you're twenty-one or thirty-one
And Christmas comes around
And you find yourself nine thousand miles from home
You'll know what ever comes

Your brothers and sisters and me and your mum
Will be waiting for you in the sun
Whenever you come
Your brothers and sisters, your aunts and your uncles
Your grandparents, cousins and me and your mum
We'll be waiting for you in the sun

Bilhões de neurônios e todos resolvem pensar em você

Foi Deus por ter esculpido
Você é um monumento em movimento
Mora no meu pensamento
Mas bem que podia ser no meu apartamento
Você é foda pra carái, e o foda é que você nem se acha foda pra carái
E eu acho isso foda pra carái
Mina eu tô na tua, minha mente te tatua, e sempre que imagino na minha frente cê tá nua!
Melhor eu calar a boca, toda rima é pouca
Pois não existe punchline mais foda que você sem roupa!

Eu tatuei seu rosto na minha mente, só
Pra toda vez que fechar os olhos eu te ver
Toda linda bem na minha frente, ó
Nem preciso dormir pra sonhar com você
Tô louco pra sentir teu cheiro no meu travesseiro
Minha boca mordendo sua boca e viajando no teu corpo inteiro, ó
Se quiser te mostro meu melhor, ó, ó
Enquanto misturamos o suor
Parece exagero, mas caso duvide
Pergunta pro meu celular minha cara quando você passa no meu feed
Ou quando passa na minha frente, fica tatuada na minha mente, é quente
Passa tanto por meu pensamento num só dia
Que se eu cobrasse pedágio com certeza eu enriqueceria
Ou enlouqueceria com esse corpo nu
Olha que visu! Nossa! Tinha que fazer uma tattoo!

Tentando esquecer só consigo lembrar
Pensando em você, não consigo parar
Se você não vem, por mim tudo bem
Se os olhos não veem eu posso imaginar

Tyler Durden make 'em holler murder
Take 'em to the highest point of the earth
No need to follow further
This shit is universal
No time to do rehearsal
I never take a break
That shit is too commercial
I wasn't raised different
I was made different
Flow don't fuck around like it was raised Christian
Anti-social with these kids
We don't play with 'em
We just keep a small circle and we stay lifted
I need monopoly bread
Told her if it ain't sex then it gotta be head
Sure you got some candles
I prefer the sloppy instead
Did my own thing and they preferred to copy instead
The money got 'em in a frenzy
Probably wanna envy
Glass half full, but the bottle's left empty
Maybe I'm a gentleman but I don't do it gently
Backwoods with the Henny
Rap good, never trendy
Need kush? Got plenty
I be off of the fumes
In tune with the rhythm
Now I'm leavin' the room
Let the mood reawaken like I'm out of the tombs
Eat shrooms, keep movin', goin' out with a boom
For the gold, I be walking every road on the map
Get a vibe low key and the flow is relaxed
But once the smoke is in the air and we pouring the Jack
We like singers turned actors, we don't know how to act
Switch it up, let your bitch pop a bean and a half
Got a queen hittin' hash, sippin' lean in the back
Bank robbery, we go in and we leave with the cash
We just gettin' what we need, see no reason to ask
Drugs unlocked doors in my mind where I'd never go
Learnin' to acknowledge while acceptin' what I'll never know
Livin' in the moment while we can 'cause you never know
Just take the energy you got baby and let it go!

I came to spit a sonnet sonically colder than comets
Surf a rocket to the moon and can't nobody stop it
I'm hyperbolic, my words curve extra wavy
Yo paint a map of the sky, shit you could call me Halley
Before that cult shit, just a cloud of smoke
When you realize you don't know shit the quicker you gon' grow
Got that van Gogh flow, go crazy on a starry night
Ate a couple boomers on my way here and I'm feelin' right
Hop up out the whip and say what up to everyone around
Met me at a show then you already know how I get down
Overdone, say I'm overdue for all these accolades
I don't really think about it
I'm just tryna rap and paint
Stack a couple bit coins
All up on my Nakamoto
Chillin' with your lady friend
She rockin' an untied kimono
Posted up in Acapulco
Shout out to the homie smoko
Loco at the show hold up, posin' for that family photo

Epic epigrams man these words last for centuries
The shit's timeless, scribe it on your tomb
Don't say the sky's the limit when there's footprints on the moon
Moon walkin' on the sun, sun beamin' I'ma star, star shootin' into space, space shippin' up to Mars, yeah
I'm universal, my purpose to pursue
This path and give back that's hows life's supposed to circle
Yo G roll that purple
Run that beat back reversal I don't need no damn rehearsal
This is internal eternal life is like a flick
Leavin' space for the horns that's my shit

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me

Than to go on living without you

Os bico fazendo zum zum zum
E na mão aquele kunk bolado
Acelerando a nova X1

Inveja de olho no meu corre

Eu mudei a expressão em meu rosto, foi medo, desgosto
Quando te vi dançando pra frente, pro lado

दिलजला सा मैं अँधेरा
एक दूजे के लिए हैं
नींद मेरी ख्वाब तेरा

बाबुल की गली आऊं छोड़ के
तेरे ही लिए लाऊंगी पिया
सोलह साल के सावन जोड़ के
प्यार से थामना... डोर बारीक है
सात जन्मों की ये पहली तारीख है

डोर का एक मैं सिरा
और तेरा है दूसरा
जुड़ सके बीच में कई तड़प है ना

जो मेरे दिल को दिल बनाती है

Girl, I sent you like seven texts
You didn't reply it's okay I guess
You found a guy? I'm not impressed
You're wasting my time, onto the next, yeah
Your worlds gonna crash down, now that I'm not in it
See, I do not care where you're at now yeah, I'm happy we ended
My music is dark, sorry my life ain't pretty
Never had friends, not a family really
Just me and my thoughts and they always stick with me
If my head is down it's 'cause I'm overthinking
Nobody gets me but you, you gave me meaning
So I was happy when you started to see me
Girl we were so perfect I gotta be dreaming
'Til I woke up like why the fuck did you leave me?
I met this girl named Sarah, I thought she was real
Thought she loved me, thought she cared how I feel
Just to find out that she doesn't, she wasn't the one
I wonder if you think of me still
She probably doesn't but fuck her I'm gone
I texted my heart - you didn't text me at all
You just sit with your friends while you're ripping the bong
'Til you lay in bed empty listening to my songs
I was there for you when you had no one involved
I wanted to heal and mend all of your scars
I flew you out I hated being apart
Said that you would move here and yeah that's what I thought
'Til you lied to me so I called it off
But then I came back 'cause my love was too strong
So now you ignore me, I just wanna talk
You won't answer my calls, dummy look who you lost!
It's fine, I don't give a damn no more
Don't really care if you're a fan no more
You're a person that I hate and can't stand no more
The best guy you ever had but can't have no more
Because of you, I'm not the person I am no more
I'm so done, and there's no upper hands no more
When time passes I bet that you won't laugh no more
You're nothing and you're not a part of my plans no more, I
[Chorus]
Gave you all I had and more
You were the one that I'd adore
'Til you showed me who you really were
Now I don't give a fuck
Said we'd be friends after our split
You lied so your words, they don't mean shit
Missing you used to make me sick
Now I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
R.I.P to the old me, all I ask is don't act like you know me
Fuck what you told me
Only thing good with that mouth is when you would drop down and you'd blow me
Girl, I know what you're thinking
""Trying all of this just because of me leaving?""
No, I told you that shit didn't matter
This is about how you treated me after
I said how I feel but it didn't exist
You hurt me, I've been hurt again and again
Ever since you started hanging with your new friends
You said ""fuck us"" and then you replaced me with them
You left a cut so deep that it never can mend
You pushed us away now we have came to an end
Please don't try to call me we cannot make amends
You hurt me so fuck no, I ain't playing pretend
I guess pushing you was probably the issue
Said you wanna sing I said you had it in you
I believed in you and girl, I was your voice
Yet you cut me off like I did something to you
All you want to do is just chill and get high
So high that you just get stuck in your mind
You really struck a nerve when you didn't reply
It's like how could you be cold to someone who tries?
I tried, but now fuck it, you left
Now that means you have to settle for less
Later in life this will be your biggest regret
I'll rise up and your life will still remain a mess
Me seeing the good in you musta have been a threat
If that's the issue you should run back to your ex
Stay complacent because you are basic at best
I love you but the love I have for you is dead, I
[Chorus]
Gave you all I had and more
You were the one that I'd adore
'Til you showed me who you really were

A prisoner of my DNA, I ain't having this
They wanted fear, but won't be afraid of the catalysts
They talking peace, but their messages come on battleships
Activists talking freedom, but their freedom comes with asterisks
Devils
They branded us with our chains, metal
Standing up, I'm untamed, feral
Brandish blood in our names, rebels
Had enough of your game's levels
Never change, we're to blame settle
Men all pray to the same temple
Fight and die for the same medals
You can not change fate
Welcome your death with a brave face
See all the hate that the grave takes
Leave our names stained, we became slaves
To the cycle of bloodshed we maintain
I've been wearing my sins like it's face paint
Put the gun to my head when I take aim
We be living this nightmare 'til day breaks
When the day breaks, then the day's saved
[Pre-Chorus: McGwire]
Rip my heart from willing arms
But they can't take my mind
Brand new start I've taken on
Vengeance is my right

[Chorus: McGwire]
And I know, I know that your eyes on me
So I won't, I won't take the time you need
So just whittle down your expectations
Your future's on the way
And I hope, I hope that you'll ride with me
And I don't, I don't care how you feel
Yeah, I don't care about the destination
Just hear what I got to say

[Verse 2: Rustage]
I see through villain eyes, villainize me, irony
Through vengeance I've been killing mine, I think I'll let the fire speak
I'm scared of what I strive to be, I've seen my paths like time machine
I hear the chimes of death before I even start to write the piece
I'm disappointed, these different voices
I've got em begging me to stop like I've been given choices
Been appointed god, but in the dark we all hear different noises
Trampled underfoot I give them death and those who live rejoices
Stains that need wiping away, look how they lie to my face, time and again
Breaking the cycle of hate, I'll make em blinded by grace, silently pray
Titan, I rise from the grave, I put my crimes on display, writing the play
I left what's mine in the grave, they want to talk, but I'm finally saved
[Chorus: McGwire]
And I know, I know that your eyes on me
So I won't, I won't take the time you need
So just whittle down your expectations

And I hope, I hope that you'll ride with me
And I don't, I don't care how you feel
Yeah, I don't care about the destination
Just hear what I got to say

[Bridge: Rustage]
The unyielding whims of fate can't be restrained as long as planets turn
I fanned the flames in hell and then complained about my scars and burns
Dictating man's morality is not a case that's been deserved
You can not judge me for my sins when all the courts have been adjourned
Men decide our justice they will view our crimes through different eyes
We're all a slave to something, but our freedom is what we decide
I'm numb to who I know I'll be the murder that I felt through time
The things we love will often be the things that cause our own demise

[Pre-Chorus: McGwire]
Rip my heart from willing arms
But they can't take my mind
Brand new start I've taken on
Vengeance is my right

So I won't give you the time you need

Cismini çizdim dön sirkine pis pire

Dinlediğini özümseyen bireylerin müziği bu
Senin gibi piyonların değil
Şampiyonların beyinlerine sahip olmak en büyük dileğin (Hahahah)
Ama mümkün değil (değil!)
İstediğini veriyorum sana
Ama karşılığında alıyorum kariyerini
Sor onlara anlatırlar
Valizlerini toplayıp yok oldular piyasadan bana yenilip
Hatırlıyo' musun? (Hah)

Yalan ettin lan kendini yok yere
Yeraltında ihtiyacın olacak şnorkele
Bizim yollar gelir zor size, git sor bizi
Yazınca duramıyorum ve bu sana çok bile
Bu dördüncü şok gibi gün dönümü yok size
Yok size Mercedes, Gucci ve Dolce Gabbana
Ne Porsche, ne bi' fors, ne bi' yol size
Bok ye sen or'da
Bu güldüğün son gece (ah!)
Hesap verme vaktin değil çünkü sana söz hakkı yok
Sus d'i'yince susucaksın böyle
Twitter’dan cevap verme devri geçti
Şimdi kinini nereye kusucaksın söyle?
Pembe şeker seni
Hep perdenin arkasından seyrediyo'n pencereden beni
Bense en tepeden bile yukarıda ""dert edemem seni""
Diyorken koyup geçtim fakat sendin tahrik eden beni
Trap, boombap hepsi bizde
Sizse tek stilde, o da çalıntı
Aynı motto, aynı argümanlar
İzle şimdi, şaklabanlar istediyse biz de oynatırız boyuna
Yeteri kadar hissediyo' musun içinde

Mutlu gözükmeye mi çalışıyo'n sen hala, bi' sal

I was locked away
A life thrown under the wheel
As each day passed
I never looked back
Just a beat down body
With a mind intact
Counting days
Inside my head

Set the trap
Stab my back
Then walk away
Framed and judged
Left behind
To take the blame

Slam the door
Cut the cord and cast aside
I don't care what it takes
You are fucking dead
I never used to be so full of hate
It just grew and grew by the hour and day
Dreams of death cold revenge
Now any means justifies the end

All of my thoughts set to kill
I never give up
Until I have your head
No matter how long whatever will come
To end your life is my reason to live

I'll haunt and hunt you down
Traitor of the brotherhood
Defect and run
A once and future failure gone
A trail of schizophrenic lies
Follow your forgotten steps
As fake laughter hides
The serpent tongue behind your breath

Veracity expelled, you thrive your deceit
Lying comes with ease
Just like your all consuming greed
The stoke of midnight passed
The penance hours nears
Each nerve alive with fear
An omen of your ending coming fast
Subjected to a beating
I'll choke the life out from your eyes
Subjected to a beating
Only when you're dead can I be free

And God won't hear you fucking scream
Cold blooded homicide
Is what it takes to be sure
To put my fist to your face
And spill your guts out on the floor

Like a thousand red stabs of pain
For each day I was locked away
You'll taste every ounce of blood
As it pours out from what used to be your head

No redemption
No regrets
No excuses
Only death

Execution so long coming, finally attained
Gasping out, last words uttered, only were my name
Pure revenge, all consuming, perfectly arranged
Satisfaction, pure elation, nothing else remains
But one less fucking human on the Earth",,0.5520963713061064,7dU9Z24yR9AKuS9cAe2Tj7

[Intro]
¿Qué va a pasar
Si tu camino
Olvida cruzarse con el mío?
¿Qué va a pasar Si nunca te olvido? Uh-oh Uh-oh-oh-oh

[Verso 1]
Me eché un clavado hasta lo más profundo en mí
Y me encontré con un puñito de sentimientos que me abruman Personalidades que no reconozco
Actitudes y comportamientos que me desmoronan}
Me parece inconcebible no haber valorado
Todos los detalles, todo el tiempo que estuviste tú a mi lado
Me consta que es verdad eso de que la gente cambia
Pero no por ser verdad es bueno y me da rabia

[Coro]
Yo cambié, me doy cuenta que cambié
Sí cambié, sé que no fue para bien
Yo cambié, reconozco que cambié, yo cambié
Y quiero saber si es tarde
Quiero quitarme estos complejos y estar bien conmigo
Quiero quererme más que a nadie pa' estar bien contigo
La vida es corta y eso los dos lo sabemos
Si nos amamos tanto, dime ¿Por qué no volvemos?

[Verso 2]
Quiero recordarte cada día que me provocas
Empaparme en energía que con tu magia desembocas
Conocer el mundo entero o lo que alcancemos
Reforzar esa promesa cada que nos abracemos
Si estás triste que no te falte ni un beso
Y llevarte a las Pig's pearls por tu maple doble queso
Comer en los lugares que nunca hemos visitado
No puedo creer que esto ya se haya terminado
Quiero acompañarte en cada triunfo y cada logro
Compartir contigo cada susto y cada asombro
Que me ayudes con mis letras y me orientes nena
Y filosofar contigo un tinto y una cena
Entendí lo que es la vida cuando vi tus ojos
Me robé un caballo para ti hace tres agostos
Lo volvería a hacer hoy
Lo volvería a hacer siempre
Que difícil es no verte
Estar sin ti es un eterno domingo
Sin mis yemas en tu cuerpo, me siento en un laberinto
No quiero regresar el tiempo pues caeríamos en lo mismo
Me importa tu tranquilidad sin egoísmo
Me doy cuenta tarde de que estuve ausente
Tú lo pedías a gritos y yo no estuve presente
Me consta que es verdad eso de que la gente cambia
Pero no por ser verdad es bueno y eso me da rabia
[Coro]
Yo cambié, me doy cuenta que cambié
Sí cambié, sé que no fue para bien

[Verso 3]
Quiero llenar la casa de momentos nuestros
Tener hijos contigo y que ellos sean nuestros maestros
Subir una montaña contigo hasta la cumbre
Volver a los viñedos del Valle de Guadalupe
Rentarnos un carrito y escaparnos donde sea
Escuchando a los aldeanos mientras que tú lagrimeas
Que con una mirada sientas nuestra conexión
Mujer, no quiero que esta sea nuestra última canción
Quiero que contestes mis llamadas con un grito
Y que por tanto que me marques te termines to' tu crédito Levantarte siempre con tacitas de café
Le falta una R pero se fue mi fe
Entendí lo que es la vida cuando conocí tu aroma
Me enamoré de ti con tres horas en Roma
Enamorado hoy, enamorado siempre

Hani hayaller karın doyurmuyodu ya
Okulu bırakmak sonum olurdu ya
Şimdi olayı çözdüm, yaşıyorum çocukluğumu hala
Eğleniyorum eskisinden de daha fazla

Dört kolla sarıldım hayalime
Dostlarım diyo'du: ''Lütfen baksana şu haline.''
Dönüştüm bi dahiye
Onlarsa dönüşmüştü haine
Şimdi hayatım dönüştü sınırsız bi tatile

Haliyle emek gerek
Biraz da emeklemek
Lütfen hakim bey bunu da ekleyin gerekçeme
Hayallerim var, satır satır sepet sepet

[Verso 1]
Todavía no echás raíces
Y ya vas en busca del sol
Puede ser fuerte el topetazo
De querer cantar un blues
Y no saber qué es un bemol
Con alas de oro, no, no
No se puede volar

Correrme de la parte más oscura
Boicoteadora que hay en mí
No es soplar y hacer botellas, no
Pero no quiero a ese cobarde que dice a todo que sí, sí
Insomnio tiene el que no está durmiendo con
Con el campeón que habita en sí

[Coro]
Y puede ser más fácil el ruido que las nueces
Treinta velas al orgullo y raticida a la humildad
Puede ser más fácil desconfiar de un je t’aime
Para no tener que afrontar el desafío carpe diem
[Puente]
Si para recobrar lo recobrado
Debí perder primero lo perdido
Si para conseguir lo conseguido
Tuve que soportar lo soportado
Si para estar ahora enamorado
Fue menester haber estado herido
Tengo por bien sufrido lo sufrido
Tengo por bien llorado lo llorado
Porque después de todo he comprobado
Que no se goza bien de lo gozado
Sino después de haberlo padecido
Porque después de todo he comprendido
Que lo que el árbol tiene de florido
Vive de lo que tiene sepultado

[Verso 2]
¿Cuántas caricias recibís al día
Por cagar más de lo normal?
La imitación es el peor suicidio
Teniendo en cuenta que morir nos vamos a morir igual
Morir en vida es tan absurdo, viejo, no
Como alterar lo natural

Como la abeja pica y muere obedeciendo a la natura

Y yo no creo en ese cuento del destino

That these shoes, and this apron
That place, and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them

I was never attention's sweet center
But I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine
And it's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a back door
And carves out a person
And makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you

You're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For that girl that I knew

Who was reckless just enough
Who gets hurt
But who learns how to toughen up when she's bruised
And gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Getting stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine

[Introdução instrumental]

[Verso 1]
Hoje aconteceu (O quê?) tudo que eu queria
Fiz coisa pra caralho, mas' no fundo eu não sabia
Fui po' banheiro apertar um pra começar a session
E depois um cigarrin', só pra ficar de borest
E na sequência, eu fui pra rua com meu skatin'
Enquanto eu andava, tofava meu diguizin'
Chegando na casa do brother, já muito doidão
Entrei pela cozinha e senti um cheiro bom
O mulek tava no quarto babano' o travesseiro
Eu disse: ""Acorda, mulek! Eu já tofei o meu primeiro""

[Pré-Refrão]
Logo depois que ele acordou, vamo' continuar a session
Minha mãe num tá em casa, então...
[Refrão]
Tá de borest
Eu disse: ""Ô""
Tá de borest (Ô ô ô)
Tá de borest...

[Verso 2]
Depois fomo' pro posto matar um laricão
Hot dog e um suquinho, isso aqui tá muito bom!
E agora não tem grana pa' comprar o meu careta
Só tenho 1,50 pa' comprar minha camiseta
Eu vou na casa da minha mina, o pai dela num tá lá
Hoje o dia vai ser bom, vai rolar o pá pá pá!
Eu te dou minha camiseta, mas compra um cigarrin'
Que depois d'um rango desse, eu tô na fissura, sim!

[Pré-Refrão]
E na inércia, nós' vazamo' pra continuar a session
Cigarrin' depois do rango, então...

[Refrão]
Tá de borest
Eu disse: ""Ô""
Tá de borest (Ô ô ô)
Tá de borest...
[Verso 3]
Depois a galera foi pro Garagem de baú
Mas' no meio do caminho, os homi deram bacu
O gambé não achou nada, a parada tava no mato
Como o gambé num sabia, ele ficou indignado
""Cadê essa parada?"", o gambé me perguntou
Eu disse: ""Não mexo com isso"", ele não acreditou
Comecei a disfarçar, mas o gambé num percebeu
E no final das conta', o pé de botas se fudeu

[Pré-Solo]
E agora não tem Jack, que é que vamo' fazer?
Que tal entrar na roda e começar... a se bater?

[Solo de Guitarra]

[Ponte]
Saindo do Garagem completamente suado (Ô ô, ô)
Eu tinha que admitir que eu tava muito passado
Mas aquela noite valeu a pena, sangue bom (Ah ah)
Além de bater cabeça, eu tava muito doidão!
Então vamo' pegar o atalho, que eu tenho que ir pra casa
Eu só vou comprar uma breja, pegar minha parada
Mas agora fudeu, eu esqueci onde moquei
Fiquei pensando e procurando, até que enfim eu encontrei, então...
Pega essa parada e bota logo aí no saco
Que o baú já vai passar, nós' vamo' chegar atrasado!
Mulek, sai dessa noia, aqui não passa mais' baú
Mas' no meio do caminho, a gente vai levar outro bacu!
[Gancho conclusivo]
Só tem mais uma fyna, vamo' continuar a session
Depois que a fyna for pra mente, tá de borest!
Só tem mais uma fyna, vamo' continuar a session
Depois que a fyna for pra mente, tá de borest!
Só tem mais uma fyna, vamo' continuar a session

Porque maconha, meu irmão não pode lhe prejudicar
Não pode te prejudicar então é bom cê se ligar
Cuidado vacilão, porque senão vou te apagar
Porque da onde eu vim, eu sei, o gatilho é a lei
Então não se esqueça, fazendo a sua cabeça !

[Refrão]

[Verso 3]
Fazendo a sua cabeça com a cultura do arrastão
Pra você poder sobreviver tem que ter boa educação
Boa educação que eu to falando não são boas maneiras
É saber distinguir, o pó da poeira
Porque malandro quando tá na pior sabe sair de lá
De lá o único barulho que eu escuto é rá-tátá rá-tatá
Cê tem que fazer a sua cabeça com que você bem quiser
Ninguém pode impedir se você sabe o que quer
Chega de hipocrisia, pare antes que eu enlouqueça
Então não esqueça, fazendo a sua cabeça !

Crawled into a place in my head
The only space where I could feel safe and sound
All that you've lived for comes spiraling down
Catatonic, emaciated
All this pain that you have created
Battered heart, broken soul
With no other place to go
[Chorus: Jesse Cash & JT Cavey, Both]
Modern mind, divisive voices redefine (your heart)
Realign what's broken
Every word misguided by thoughts left confined (confined)
You could leave it all behind
Modern mind, divisive voices redefine (your heart)
You could leave it all behind

[Post-Chorus: JT Cavey]
The small hours loud inside the modern mind
Leeching on the lonely heart

[Bridge: Jesse Cash]
Modernity seems to amplify
The boundaries of your heart
You try going back when you need to restart
And the foundation falls apart
The foundation falls apart
On and on and on

[Breakdown: JT Cavey]
Spiraling downward
Spiral down, spiral down
Spiral down, oh
Reset the pattern doomed to repeat
A perpetual cycle, on and on and on

[Intro]
Olha, olha, olha
Olha, olha, olha

[Verso 1]
Olha quem eu trombei na festinha, o contatinho antigo
Que me viu com a sua amiguinha e nunca mais falou comigo
Tu tá muito estressadinha, calma, calma, que que é isso?
Eu tô sendo bem sincero, Rick falando a verdade
Eu nem lembro de você, mas meu piru tá com saudade
Ele bate, bate, na cueca ele bate
Doido pra poder comer uma buceta de qualidade
Ele bate, bate, na cueca ele bate
Doido pra poder comer uma buceta de qualidade

[Verso 2]
Me bloqueou de tudo, que que aconteceu?
Mania dessa menina, ciúmes do que não é seu
Me bloqueou de tudo, que que aconteceu?
Mania dessa menina, ciúmes do que não é seu
Deixa ela com a sua amiga porque as duas se entende
Uma combina com a outra mesmo sendo diferente
Uma vai pra trás, outra vai pra frente, ela vai pra trás, pra frente
Dança quatro horas direto, tem que ter o bumbum potente
Ela vai pra trás, ela vai pra frente, ela vai pra trás, pra frente
Dança quatro horas direto, tem que ter o bumbum potente
[Verso 3]
Quer parar de rolé, falou que quer sossegar
Que se rolar um evento pra sua amiga não chamar
Mas não dá, não dá, não dá, não dá
Tenta ficar em casa, mas o evento é open bar
Então não dá, não dá, não dá, não dá
Tenta ficar em casa, mas o evento é open bar

[Verso 4]
Morava nos Estados Unidos, nossa, que menina chique
Veio pro Brasil e só escuta MC Rick (Brasil)
Vou chamar pra conversar já que ela gostou do pique

Eu quero conversar com o mar

A blue, só pra dizer, a blue
Uma de até tattoo
Seu nome no peito
Deito na areia e penso
Se você tá tenso

Me dá um abraço

Maria e Bonifácio

[Verso 2]
Quando era pequena
Minha vó ficava sentada na sala
Naquela cadeira de balanço
Enquanto o bairro balançava
Ao som da quebradeira eu subia e descia as ladeiras do bairro
E quando amanhecia era uma poesia
O sol nasce de frente pra laje
E ali era o auge, auge das brisa que eu tinha
Ventania traz com ela uma energia (Ah, ah)
Com ela o perfume da minha tia Gina (Ah, ah)
Pudim de tapioca fresquinho vendido no portão daquela casa vizinha (Ah, ah)
Mais tarde abará, acarajé, caruru e o picolé da capelinha
Vida é tão bonita
O caminhão de gás sempre tocava, aquela melodia
Preciso ver se ainda é a mema hoje em dia
Saudade da vibe que isso me trazia
Mano isso que é vida, não que eu não goste da ideia de um dia ficar rica
E dar uma melhor condição pra todas as pessoas que vivem na minha família
Mas tudo do jeito que era, era perfeitamente completo
E eu agradecia toda vez que eu podia ir à Bahia (Ah, ah)
Encontrar a essência que corre no meu sangue (Ah, ah)
Se expandir perante à minha [?] (Ah, ah)
Eu faço um convite
Visite quem não tem a intenção de roubar a sua brisa
Respeito na essência de quem compartilha
Pra quem aprecia a minha correria
Independentemente de qual for a vila

Like ships in the night letting cannon balls fly
Say what you mean and it turns to a fight
Fist fly from my mouth as it turns south
You're down the driveway, I'm on the couch
Chasing your dreams since the violent 5th grade
Trying to believe in your silent own way
Cause we'll be ok... I'm not going away
Like you watched at fourteen as it went down the drain
And pops stayed the same and your moms moved away
How many of our parents seem to make it anyway?
We're just fumbling through the grey
Trying find a heart that's not walking away

Walk these halls alone

[Verse 2]
And I'm at the airport waiting on a second plane
Had to pack and you had cramps and I was late
Headed to a red carpet they won't know my name
Riding in silence all that we wanna say
About to board when you call on the phone
You say ""I'm sorry. I'll be waiting at home""
Feels like we're learning this out on our own
Trying to find a way down the road we don't know

Walk these halls alone

In the form of a girl who hates her life
As she sits alone on the floor of her bedroom
Waiting for answers, wasting time

Here it is again, the son of a soldier
Remington shotgun, rolled up sleeves
To keep Satan out of the walls of the suburbs
His last bastion of modernity

But Satan waits upstairs, watching over his daughter
She writes emo songs, she's so depressed
Her lyrics are naive but she still sings her heart out
The only way she knows how to confess

And as she gets up to shut the bedroom door behind her
He stands right beside her, she's trying to get her head on straight
With box dye hair to match her black thigh highs
And scratched nail polish, she performs femininity
She laughs so hard I watch her lose her balance, fall over backwards
To the arms of Mephistopheles
But she'll never leave her bedroom in this bedroom community
He said you'll never be OK, K, if you don't come to your senses
With you everything's the end of the world

I'm sure you got it from that stupid girl

You'll never be OK, if you don't come to your senses
But I feel so defenseless, so alone
I thought he was right when he said that he loved me
He's still thinking of me from up there

And as they stop to look at her they won't look further
Like it's not a murder, it's an inevitable tragedy
The bloody hands of all the heartless fuckers
Who emotionally fucked her to monetize her suffering
Flipping through a spiral notebook for some
Sad hopeless words to turn into a liturgy
So she'll never leave her bedroom in this bedroom community

Yo

[Verse 1]
Birçok kez öldüğümü biliyorum
Kenarından-köşesinden hayata tutunduğumu
Güneşimin günlerce tutulduğunu
Güzel günlerin kısa hikâyeler anlatan misafirler olduğunu, sonra yok olduğunu
Onlar gidince yok olduğumu (yeah), kendimden yoksunluğumu
İnsanın yoksunluğunu, kötü günün kenarda pusu kurduğunu
Akbabanın sessizliğini bilip duymak kurdun uluduğunu

Birçok kez öldüğümü biliyorum
Ruhum üzerimdeyken öldürüldüğümü
Gözüm açık bakarken Dünya'ya körlüğümü
Katillerimi bizzat gözümle gördüğümü, cinayetin örtüldüğünü
Biliyorum aslında her bir şeyin gerçek yüzünü
İnsanların yüzsüzlüğünü, her şeye rağmen bendeki güçsüzlüğümü
Eksik kelimeli sözlüğümü, karanlığımın güneşime karşı üstünlüğünü

Birçok kez öldüm, yeniden hayata döndüm

Birçok kez öldüğümü biliyorum
Bilenlerin bilmemezlikten geldiği zamanlarda
Elimi sıkıca tutanların bıraktığı anlarda
Doğrularımı yalanlamaya çalıştıklarında (yo), çatıştıklarında
Böyle gaddarca davrandıklarında bedbahtça kıvranırım iftiranın kollarında
Düşüncelerim turlar yalnızlık koridorlarında
Bi' yalnızı ancak bir yalnızlık öldürebilir etrafında
Birçok kez öldüğümü biliyorum
Bilirken bilmemezlikten gelmek zorunda olduğum vakitlerde
İçimden geleni içimde hapsettiğim seferlerde
Zincire vurduğum haklı hislerimi gördüğümde
Yalnızlığın kendini gösterdiği yalnızlığımda
Ruhu yıkan depremlerin ansızlığında (aha)
Harabede gördüğüm benin cansızlığında (aha)
Ölmeyen hırsın yıldıran arsızlığında

And the future of many youth, if I play my cards can advance, and-
Genuine dime, I opened my mind, and where can I find this future?
Sever your mind or you will be blind, and trapped in a mind of lies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation

Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh

Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?

Look into the mirror and I don’t know what to do
Momma telling me come here to show me what’s on the news
A kid of 9 years was hiding away the truth
From their parents it appears that he was bullied at school
They found him in his room hanging up from the ceilin’
Momma told me Rodger you better tell me jus’ how feelin’
I laughed momma you don’t have to worry ‘bout a thang
Gave a kiss, called my bus and I cried along the way
I was getting picked on in the lunch line
All my friends ate I ain't never touched mine
While my girls fuckin’ ‘round with another guy
Dark thoughts started weighing on my young mind
But I ain't never been the type to go and unwind
So if you ask my reply is just “I’m fine”
Until I get home my mind doesn’t comply
I just lie in my bed and just lie in my head

[Chorus]
Everything’s alright
No sleepin, it replays all night
No eating, only take small bites
No speaking, keep my jaw locked tight
Momma asking, “Everything alright? ”
I smile, “Everything’s alright...
I promise everything’s alright, everything’s alright”

I’ve tried and I’ve tried and ion think I can do it
Only thing by my side is my momma and music
And I know that she gon' cry, maybe never get through it
But that don’t wanna be alive and death is telling me prove it
Bullies telling me do it, teachers thinking I’m stupid
My nightmares turn to dreams, and get more lucid and lucid
Feel like a waste of a human, my friends find it amusing
So I just hope they get a laugh at what I’m ‘bout to go thru with
Open the drawer and find
A boxcutter and slide it down my wrist
And let the blood run and spill of the sides
I scream and i cry cuz yes it hurts to die
But I can slowly feel the pain make its way out my mind
I’m sorry that I wasn’t good enough for you guys
And strong enough to fight the pain so I’m saying goodbye
As my life subsides, I close my eyes
And just lie in my bed, and just lie in my head
[Chorus]
Everything’s alright

No eating, only take small bites

Waiter, send this to the table, the party of one
The only other lonely soul in this place
And so you're finishing up your coffee
But then where’re you gonna run?
Where'd you get that look on your face?

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
You should always let the sun go down on your anger
And let it burn you to sleep
And bring it closer to danger
To surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep

I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
And I am tired but I am yours

[Verse 3: Sam Smith & Brandi Carlile]
Don't even think about your freedom
Or taking that flight
Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your ""I"" statements
And your weaponised words
Are paper tigers now
Oh, your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking
Are making you more and more alone
And girl, you can slam the door behind you
It ain’t ever gonna close
Because when you're home, you're already home
[Chorus; Sam Smith & Brandi Carlile]
I am tired, I am tired, tired
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still

And you know I love you still
I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord, I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore

Showed me fake love, it was shameless
I should've known that we would never make it
Now my heart is cold, feeling vacant
I just wanna move on

Lied to me and said you wouldn't run
The echoes in my head go on and on
But I'll be fine, I'm better off without you

Yeah, you really know how to mess up a good thing
Actin' like you care, you weren't there for my dark days
How could I have been so blind?
Let you walk right over me
I gave you time
Now I'm off that

But I'm so ashamed of all the time I waste
Now I do my own thing, I won't let you slow me down

One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-four

She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?

If death is what it seems
Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor
Mind's full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate
Your conversates, hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions, then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then 'cause there was no reacting, acting up

Accurate facts put the black, in fact, if you thought that
You are free, you should disregard that, all facts

I got a plan to run up some bands
You tell me I can't, I tell you, I am
Free all my brothers that's stuck in the can
Glizzy on me, .38, it won't jam
Opp pack, I can make you a strand
Free Mark, he went dumb off a Xan'
Fake jeans, that shit come from Japan
I be flexing, you can look at my 'Gram
Bitches see me and they know who I am
Lil Tjay, oh my God, I'm a fan
Lil Tjay, oh my God, I'm the man
I remember I was whippin' the pan
Wasn't right, but I did what I can
Fuck it, though, 'cause I'm just livin' my life
Remember times when the day wasn't bright
Half a pint up in a two-liter Sprite
I'ma make sure all my niggas aight
Commissary and I'm shippin' out kites
Takin' off, 'bout to book me a flight
Diamonds dancin' in the middle of night
Fire bitches started bein' polite
I remember when I wasn't they type
Now they figure I can better they life
I ain't listenin' to niggas' advice
Unless I feel what you tellin' me right
Fuck tomorrow, I'ma ball for tonight
I got potential to ball like I'm Mike
VVS diamonds, no regular ice
Heard a mistake when they see me on sight
Bitch, all that talkin' endanger your life
I keep a strap, Lil Tjay a dyke
Bread on my head, I could double the price, nigga
[Chorus]
Runnin' your mouth
I'll have my young niggas run in your house
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out
Bitch, you could mob, and no toungin' me down
Make fun of me now, they see me like, ""Wow""
Niggas that hate they gon' wanna be down, runnin' your mouth
I'll have my young niggas run in your house
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out, ayy

[Verse 2]
Designer belt holdin' my pants up
This money gon' call, I'ma answer
I used to be down, well, look at me now
I just fucked some bitch named Amanda
And bitches be blingin' my hotline
Drop top at the stop sign
You say that you flexin', boy, stop lyin'
And your bitch an eater, she not mine
And I'm goin' straight to the top, watch how I open up shop
Fuck out my way, I don't need you, I be great
Gettin' to it out of state
I need a bag, that's the reason why I spaz
Every time I'm on the track
Foot on the gas, leave them niggas in the past
I remember I was trash
Down to my last, I ain't never even ask
Now I look at y'all and laugh
Niggas be mad, why don't you look at my dab?
It's crazy this happened so fast
I'm on the road and I'm bringin' my bros
I'ma do it for all of the guys on the ave
Pop me a flag, pop me a tag
Sippin' dirty, I don't know how to act
They said I'm the new A Boogie, relax
I ain't never try to copy his swag
I'm just tryna put my hood on the map
Ellie use to live right next to the trap
Love or hate me, I'ma get to the racks
Skippin' niggas and they pull ya back
I was sleepy, I was takin' a nap
Ah, nah, nah

Blah!

[Verse 1]
I was born in a messed up century
My favourite flavoured sweets are raspberry amphetamines
I bought a car, Beretta, age 16
I brush my teeth with bleach 'cause I ain't got time for cavities
My daddy put a gun to my head
Said, ""If you kiss a boy, I'm gonna shoot you dead""
So I tied him up with gaffer tape and I locked him in a shed
Then I went out to the garden and I fucked my best friend

[Chorus]
'Cause my high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone
It's alright, we'll survive
'Cause parents ain't always right

[Verse 2]
Drop a toaster in my bath, watch my mum and dad laugh
See a thousand volts go through the son they wish they never had
They told me casual affection leads to sexual infection
But it's hard to get an erection when you're so used to rejection
Yeah, the teacher fucked the preacher
But then he had to leave her
Had to wash away the sins of a male cheerleader
""Hi, nice to meet ya,"" got nothing to believe in
So let me know when my breathing stops

[Chorus]
'Cause my high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low
But I know I'll never be alone

Deja de mentirte (Ah)

Bebé, yo te conozco tan bien, sé que fue pa' darme celos
No te diré quién, pero llorando por mí te vieron
Por mí te vieron

Déjame decirte
Se ve que él te trata bien, que es todo un caballero
Pero eso no cambiará que yo llegué primero
Sé que te va ir bien, pero no te quiere como yo te quiero

[Verso]
Miéntele a todos tus seguidore'
Dile que los tiempo' de ahora son mejore'
No creo que cuando te llame me ignores
Si después de mí ya no habrán más amores
Tú y yo fuimo' uno
Lo hacíamo' en ayuna' antes del desayuno
Fumábamo' la hookah y te pasaba el humo
Y ahora en esta guerra no gana ninguno
Si me preguntas, nadie tiene culpa
A vece' los problemas a uno se le juntan
Déjame hablar, porfa, no me interrumpas
Si te hice algo malo, entonces discúlpame
La gente te lo va a creer, actúas bien ese papel
Baby, pero no eres feliz con él

(슈가)
난생 처음 방탄이란 이름으로 선 무대
삼년 전 첫무대의 마음을 다시 검문해
여전히 대구 촌놈 랩퍼와 다를게 없었지 but
아마추어란 단어 위에 프로란 단어를 덧 썼지
그토록 원하던 무대 랩을 하며 춤 출때
아직 살아 있음을 느껴 피곤하고 고된 출퇴근
따위는 견딜만해 내사람들이 지켜보니까
몸이 아파도 버틸만해 함성들이 밀려 오니까
데뷔 전후의 차의점 아이돌과 랩퍼 사이 경계에
살아도 여전히 내 공책엔 라임이 차있어
대기실과 무대 사이에선 펜을 들고 가사를 써
이런 내가 니들 눈에는 뭐가 달라졌어?
Damn, shit 난 여전해
내가 변했다고? (what?) 가서 전해
변함없이 본질을 지켜 I'm still rapperman
3년전과 다름없이 랩하고 노래해 I'm out

[랩몬스터] 솔직해 두려웠었어 큰 소린 쳐놨는데 날 증명한다는게
펜과 책만 알던 애가 이제 세상을 놀래킨다는게 I dunno
세상의 기대치와 너무 비대칭 할까봐 두려웠어
나를 믿어줬던 모든 사람들을 배신하게 될까봐
무건운 어께를 펴고 첫 무대에 올라
차나의 짧은 정적 숨을 골라
내가 지켜봤던 사람들이 이젠 날 지켜보고 있네
항상 올려봤던 TV속 그들이 지금은 내 밑에
Uh 주마등처럼 스칠 틈도 없이 한번뿐인 연극은 시작 돼버렸지
3번만에 증발한 내 3년의 피땀 피터지는 마이크와의 기싸움
몇십초일 뿐이었지만 똑똑히 쏟아내 I'm fucking real
야임마 니 꿈은 뭐야 나는 랩스타가 되는 거야 can't you feel
그리고 내려온 순간 그 함성 yeah I could read your mind (uh yeah)
I could read your mind 물음표 내신 미소만
말없이 멤버들은 그저 내 어깨를 두드렸줬어
꼭 엊그제같은데 스무 밤이 흘러가 버렸어
And let the haters hate on me 걔네가 늘상 해온 일

You are appreciated

[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken

Let all the hurt inside of you die

I don't wanna break your heart, so you better leave
It’s not that I don't love you, I'm just losing myself mentally
And yeah, I'd rather scream than use you as my remedy
I’m scared to open up
I’m scared to really feel
Afraid of my own mind
I don't know if I will heal
I wish that you weren’t real
I wish this ended when I woke up
And my high is my sobriety
I wish someone would save us
I know it's not my destiny to die without a legacy
I guess I am my enemy
Yeah, why’d I look through memories?

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it

I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it

I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could, I'd relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Then kill a woman with many children? Makes you a chump

Think about the people who own it for 'bout a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair

Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views,” and etcetera, knives thrown

The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up

Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

There were people standing all around
Something warm running through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me, darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window
I saw the flickering shadow of love on her blind
She was my woman
As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind

My, my, my Delilah
Why, why, why Delilah
I could see, that girl was no good for me
But I was lost like a slave that no man could free

At break of day when that man drove away I was waiting
I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door
She stood there laughing
I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

My, my, my Delilah
Why, why, why Delilah
So before they come to break down the door
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take anymore

And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories

With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Hides his emotions
His blood is running cold
Just like his victories

She was 19 with a baby on the way
On the EastSide of the city, she was working every day
Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake
She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change
And 'cross town she would take the bus at night
To a one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light
She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright
She was waiting on the day she hoped her baby would arrive

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd never be alone
Have someone to hold
And when nights were cold
She'd say

The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad
If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect, when the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you

They were 90 and were living out their days
On the Westside of the city, next to where they got engaged
They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made
And though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed
With each other, and though some times were hard
Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart
No, they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car
But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart
Even at the end
Their love was stronger than
The day that they first met
They'd say

The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad
If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your lover, and I'll hold your hand

I know she'd never leave me, and I hate to see her cry
So I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side
I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side

When the morning cries and you don't know why

With no one to love you, you're

I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

[Verse 1: Scarface]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'

I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me
[Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]
This year, Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!

So up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

Got a chase last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
Still ran away though, for the laugh
Just for the laugh
And please just stop talking
'Cause they won't find us if you do
Oh, those silly boys in blue
Well, they won't catch me and you

""Have you been drinking, son?
You don't look old enough to me""
""I'm sorry, officer
Is there a certain age you're supposed to be?
'Cause nobody told me""
And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in the riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win

I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Said it'd all be worth the wait

It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go

It's in my heart and in my head
You can't take back the things you said

Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no
Oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)

Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)

All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

Now you suck
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?

[Verse 1: TV Girl]
So how should I begin this?
I guess it started when you were with him
And how he never even took you out to dance
But did he fuck with any rhythm?
But now he's playing with your head
But did he ever make you cum?
Did he ever make you cry?
Do the wires in your mind get sewn together?
Rubbed and severed by the heat
You don't know how long I could stare into your picture
And wish that it was me
I guess it's different 'cause you love him
But I've got an interactive
Sick and twisted imagination
And that's gotta count for something

I dreamt of standing in your doorstep
Licking sweat off of your forehead
With your finger in my mouth
And the sound when leather jackets hit the ground
You should hear when you're not around
When it's just us horny poets
Who can't wait to write it down
And swear we were only being honest
Do you like these little sonnets?
'Cause I wrote them just for you
But how quickly they turn sour
So be careful who you screw
And never call
And I'm starting to suspect
You don't intend to do anything you say at all

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise

'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em

And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me

You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

You should lower your beauty standards

See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)

A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe

Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter

You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man

I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does

So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it

About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now

Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to

I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah...

'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'

Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah

Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)

Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, ""Love is forever and ever""

Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day
