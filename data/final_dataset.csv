Living easy, lovin' free

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches

I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)

There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)

Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain

She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)

Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

[Verse 2]
Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it
[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking

Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

They'll say that I was clever

To get away from your parents

Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet

Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

Maluma, baby

Apenas sale el sol y tú te vas corriendo
Sé que pensarás que esto me está doliendo
Yo no estoy pensando en lo que estás haciendo
Si somos ajenos y así nos queremos (mm-mm-mm)

Si conmigo te quedas, o con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo porque sé que volverás
Si conmigo te quedas, o con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo porque sé que volverás

Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz, felices los 4
Te agrandamo' el cuarto
Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz, felices los 4
Yo te acepto el trato

Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Y lo hacemo' otro rato (alright-alright, baby)

[Verso 2]
Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Lo nuestro no depende de un pacto
Disfruta y sólo siente el impacto
El boom boom que te quema, ese cuerpo de sirena
Tranquila que no creo en contratos (y tú menos...)

[Refrán]
Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí, y felices los 4
No importa el qué dirán, nos gusta así
(Te agrandamos el cuarto, baby)
Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí, y felices los 4
No importa el qué dirán, somos tal para cual

Always pulled me from my seat

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)

Where hate don't need a reason (Loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""

You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy, or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man,"" 'cause—

I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

There's no regret

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I-I-I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober

I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers

Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight

I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"", she say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on somethin' tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in

And despite my growing fears

{Inaudible Chatter}

[Verse 1]
Ohh!
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Verse 2]
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'

[Bridge 1]
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again

[Bridge 2]
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

Ohh!

Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I'm a man (Hello?)
Can you hear me? (Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit (What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love to cum when you have sex? (Ayy)
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick's (Uh)
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth (The Earth)

[Ariana Grande]
Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet

Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon

Yeah, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stake for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors

[Verse 1]
Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spin for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' a lot of cappin', watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of thе witness
[Chorus]
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been supеrstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch

Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch, when I slide
Nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Kutthroat Businezz, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get out, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm on probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen none yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)

You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden

Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow

No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

Damn Kai, you goin' crazy

I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friends, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bro, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we're the who's who's?
Still run around with mohawk, Jet ready, pack the Goyard
People think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is ""Baby, keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick divided
Bro ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be knowin' the rundown, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come check, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full court press, foot on they neck and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat and tears come with these checks and it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gone get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' playdoh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spend good, I'm on my way to Clayco

I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

Overbuyin' cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'm gonna pull up and spray that
Livin' like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like yo mama with the switch ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bro taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies

It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall

You did some things that you regret, still ride for you

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher

These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw

'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)

Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious

I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em

But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway

And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be

[Verse 1: Kruddz]
Came from the bottom, had to stack my pence
Never goin' broke, that's common sense
With bro, bring a ratchet friend
Rollin' with smoke, just in case of nonsense
In this life they'd rather see me down, oh
That's why I wake up, thank God, oh
Look around, many rivals
Have to bun man's flesh for survival

[Verse 2: Mojo]
Who's that +234? That's my Naij babe
Never seen you before, how you my mate?
I can't even trust myself in this climate
Animal instincts, no primate
Cuttin' through Euston, doing what I'm used to
Packs flyin' like a rocket from Houston
I can't love you the way that I used to
You know what? I better go get a new you

Shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite

Shake, shake, shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party

[Verse 3: Dope]
If it ain't money, then why you in my mentions?
No, I don't want no lames in my section
What I'm in ain't a rental
That's why she had her eyes on me when she entered
Having brekkie for dinner, how could I give you advice?
You can probably snake me once, but you can't do it twice
Yeah, I made it and I said I always will like Mike
Yeah, I made it and I said I always will like Mike

[Verse 4: Papii Abz]
I put the fashion in fashionably late
Been puttin' work and nothin' ain't changed
Power in me from my ancestry
Got me seein' things I could never have seen
Don't just do this for elómì
Do it for the squad, family
Don't pretend you're a friend with me
Vibes tell me you're an enemy

Yo estaba medio psycho y tú me prestaste el vape
Mami, ya pa' chingar yo tenía los Today
Te saqué a bailar y ahí yo me quedé
Te pusiste mis cadena' y el cuello te tiré

Hey, hey

Bientôt, j'irai au ciel rejoindre Rimkus, le p'tit Lamine
Regarde la vie qu'on mène, on fait ça que pour la famille
On a toujours fait que du sale et nos parents ne font que prier
Pardonne-moi si j'suis pas là, c'est qu'je cours derrière les milliers
J'suis avec Savastano dans un quatre étoiles en Crête
Pas très loin de Malia, elle est chargée sous le maillot
Le nez dans mes affaires, bébé, m'attends pas pour le dîner
Et si c'est trop bizarre, bah, j'disparaîtrais comme Houdini
Vaillant comme Souleymane, vaillant comme Mekness et di-Meh
À deux doigts d'péter l'million, mais ce pédé s'fait désirer
Pour l'instant, j'suis dans le hall, sous doré, j'réfléchis
Qui aura l'sourire en coin d'bouche si je flanche ?
Ceux qui parlent fort sont que des baltringues déguisées
J'ai les chaussures qui piquent, j'arrive vers les Champs-Élysées
On peut t'enlever la vie pour sauver nos réputations
Évitons toutes les tentations, à l'heure qu'il est, j'suis dans l'avion
On tire, laisse-les planter, j'arrive en tête du peloton, j'suis là que pour la plata (J'suis là que pour la plata)
Le lundi et le mardi, le gérant se lève à cinq heures par peur qu'on vienne l'éclater (Par peur qu’on vienne l'éclater)

Y a rien d'facile dans l'argent facile, Zé Pequeno me fascine
.357 Magnum, pas de grappling
Y a la volaille qui rapplique, on s'échappe
Minuit, pété sous champ', demain, j's'rai aux Seychelles
Et pour avoir cette vie-là, j'ai remonté les bretelles
Quand le rêve est trop long, le réveil est brutal
Black Panther, comme la daronne de 2Pac
Les barreaux ou les tropiques, on prendra l'argent d'tout-par
Et de toute façon, c'est nous les bests, en vrai
Dis-leur qu'ils restent tranquilles ou le machin va discuter
Tu veux donner des coups de mains ? Allez, baise ton père
J'ai mon papier, j’ai mon équipe, j'suis pas dans la mendicité

Élève dissipé d’après les dires du prof'
Cinq ans plus tard, son fils me demandera une to-ph'
Cinq-cents milles albums plus tard, ma tête a pas gonflé
Le prochain s’appellera ""Destin"", j'vais tout vous raconter (Et j'dirai que la vérité)

Bientôt, j'irai au ciel rejoindre Rimkus, le p'tit Lamine

[Intro: All]
Lovesick girls
Lovesick girls

[Verse 1: Jennie, All]
영원한 밤
창문 없는 방에 우릴 가둔 love (Love)
What can we say?
매번 아파도 외치는 love (Love)

[Verse 2: Lisa]
다치고 망가져도 나
뭘 믿고 버티는 거야
어차피 떠나면 상처투성인
채로 미워하게 될걸
끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어
이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo, Rosé]
아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
But I don't care, I'll do it over and over
내 세상 속엔 너만 있으면 돼
[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Post-Chorus: All]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

[Verse 3: Lisa, Jennie]
No love letters, no X and O's
No love, never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone
Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo]
아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
불안한 내 눈빛 속에 널 담아
아프더라도 너만 있으면 돼
[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Post-Chorus: All]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

[Bridge: Rosé, Jisoo]
사랑은 slippin' and fallin'
사랑은 killin' your darlin'
아프다 아물면 또 찾아오는 이 겁 없는 떨림
들리지 않아 what you say
이 아픔이 난 행복해
나를 불쌍해 하는 네가 내 눈엔 더 불쌍해

[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔없인 난 아무 의미가 없어
[Interlude: Lisa]
One, two

[Outro: All, Rosé, Jennie]

To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her

Giving me love when you are down and need another

[Intro]
Yo, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Niggas speak down on my name like I wasn't there for 'em (There for 'em)
Talk about back in the days, this isn't back in the days (Back in the days)
They want me back in my ways, chipped tooth and the fade (Tooth and the fade)

[Verse 1]
Uh, musically I'm on Mars
Walkin' all over the beat, puttin' my feet on the stars
I rock it like Lenny, thinkin' like Jimi the first time he seen a guitar
Standin' in front of where they shot Ahmaud and said we gotta know who we are (Know who we are)
Uh, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Wearin' rare Jordans straight from Air Jordan, this a fair warnin'
Too many young gods beef over nothin'
When you get money, you know that it's comin'
Sayin' they homies, but they ain't a hunnid
We the most hunted, uh
I got my Mets hat on to the back (Back)
Y'all already know where we goin' with the stats (Stats)
Hall of fame only, kings and queens only (Queens only)
They all be grabbin' my style but you know they can't hold me
Yeah, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Y'all still on the ground, you know I've been airborne (I've been airbone)
Studyin' Big, studyin' Nietzsche
You gotta call in a chopper to reach me
Homie, I don't need a jeweler to freeze me
Ice in my veins, I make it look easy
Mentally, I'm in Queens
More money more problems, you gotta be ready for all that it brings
Let 'em say what they say, revenge on my plate, I'm lovin' the taste
They see you shinin', emotions get hard to contain
They just not evolvin' the same (The same)
Me and HB is too rare
I'm movin' all through the snares, sound on billionaire
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm flippin' the page
I'm Prince on the stage, SLAVE on his face
You know what they say, KD the wave
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days  (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
Part II

[Verse 2]
Levels of Tarantino
Curbin' my ego, even though he know
Empty glass of Pinot, cigars and casinos
What they especially praise is the ethos
Stacks on blackjack, movin' my chips
No superstition to make me get rich
I'm with this chick, just one I brought today
In between placin' my bets, we shopped at Cartier
Rose gold I copped her a set
Runway hopped in the jet, flight attendant poppin' Moet
I said I need that Dom, off of respect
We havin' conversations, niggas show me property then
I call my nigga Ant, I told him, ""Yo, I gotta be there""
Salmon shish kebab, in a misty fog, rollin' sticky log
Big dawg affair, no kids involved
Roundtable havin' war council
Press one button, it'll change the world around you
Too rare, nothin' to see here, Cuban over my streetwear
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you just to be fair
It's okay to keep the mystique, I learned that in the street
On me, solo or deep, I'm puttin' on for the G's

Part III
[Verse 3]
(Hit-Boy)
We been doin' gangsta shit for a long time
Look inside my mind, see a gold mine
I'm my own cosign, she textin' the old line
You keep starin' at the glow, bitch, don't go blind
Braveheart energy, fuck all of the enemies

I'm not here to be friendly, they ain't even contendin'

낭만은 개뿔
눈치 없는 차들 땜에 금방 새까매진 거 봐
걷기도 빡세 눈밭보단 갯벌
무릎까지 다 젖은 바지
조금 걷다가 나자빠짐
특별한 날 특별하길
변질됐지 별일 없길
뒹굴뒹굴 뒹굴다 눈덩이만 부었지
어제 만든 눈사람은 멀쩡하려나
아 따가 부러
칼바람에 베여 칭칭
Brrr, 떨리는 목소리
컬러풀은 무슨 풀 하나 안 보여
랩하다 콜록콜록콜록 기침

뭐가 부끄러워서, ayy, 귀 따갑도록 빨개졌네
뽀샤시는 무슨 눈에 김 꼈다 나름 퀄리티 굿 필터 (Oh)
오 피해가 피해가 폭설 맞은 패딩을 짜내면 오리터

Caught up in circles

Nothing changed 還是討厭下雨天
還是不愛認錯
脾氣是硬了點
這我都清楚但我沒有辦法改變
我後悔高中花錢裝很吵的排氣管
想努力賺錢養妳 卻養成了壞習慣
我還想帶妳到處晃晃到處帶妳玩
'Cause me without you it feels like
情人節沒有愛人
像台相機沒有快門
像張書桌沒有檯燈
'Cause me without you it feels like

A sentence without no spaces
It be like youtube without no playlist
Or a chapter without no pages
'Cause me without you it feels just wrong

I don’t wanna live without you
I dont wanna be alone and
想念妳的每個角度
如果我們還能夠重來
Oh
You don’t know how I feel inside
So
I don’t wanna live without you
我沒有辦法

'Cause I’ve been through that
重蹈覆徹 I can’t do that
沒得負責 Oh damn too bad
I need you right now, yo, where you at?
先把我的面子放兩邊
榨乾我就像搶劫
Goddamn, I got nothing left
掉進去 No fun down here
救救我 I call my friends
訴苦 說了好幾遍
他們叫我振作點
I know man but I fuckin can’t
幫我刪了 Instagram
Your post I don’t wanna see
想到妳曾promise me
我乾掉一支Hennessy

I just wanna know, baby, why you gonna go?
我們之間太多 的我捨不得放手 yeah
失去妳就像失去我的麥克風
我不要我的fans 不要IG的followers 'cause—

半生中的记忆在盘旋
第五十三天后的日夜线
等黑夜问白天
能不能赦免 灰色的人间
别交换吧日夜

来自暮光的 明信片
它无声无色无言
翻过山巅跟我扮鬼脸

拼命的往前 听不到救援
命运太疯癫 每一眨眼 都很玄
那对逆光中的黑雁
也飞过去老远
等再见不如说一次再见 挑一天
皮肤之下的瘀青渗着血
细胞之中的绝望在喊冤
被五十三天的孤单抽一鞭
等黑夜问白天

冰封的眼泪 一滴就很咸
来自暮光的 明信片
它无声无色无言
翻过山巅跟我扮鬼脸
喊黑夜吻白天
谢谢了时间 弄红了双眼
往事的光圈 每一瞬间 都很绝
那跑过去的昼夜 是孤独的修炼
说再见不如忘掉能再见
在半空中真好 不会吵 人少
却看得到那些近在天边的风暴
黑夜吻白天
谢谢了时间 弄红了双眼

说再见不如忘掉能再见
