You ain't talking 'bout us

We gon' leave niggas stuck
Put a nigga face in the mud

'Cause my team gon' bust

Put a nigga face in the mud

[Verse 1]
See it's 24-7 and 365
I be out in that drive tryna touch a few bands
Tryna flip a few yams, tryna whip a few pots
But these niggas too fake
Always sneak hate, we don't see eye-to-eye
Lil' niggas freeze up, now they wanna switch up
I knew we wasn't gon' ride, but it ain't my fault
And it ain't my loss, so it ain't nothin' to wipe it off
I'm just tryna be a boss, ain't gotta pay that cost and stay away from the laws
My niggas Great Dane's, Clifford, big red dogs
Hot niggas, hot sauce
For a lil' piece of change it'll get a nigga gone, wack a whole clique off
You ain't talking 'bout me 'cause I've been in these streets
See me seven days of the week
Let a nigga wanna tweak
And I'ma grab street sweep, sweep a nigga like a broom off his feet
Catch Lil' Tunechi and it's a RIP
Still screaming out, ""Fuck Cream Team""
If a nigga want me it ain't hard to find me
South side [?] where I be, posted on T-block
Tryin' make me a knot, see the jakes, gotta run from the cops
I don't fuck with no opps, so it's fuck Wag Block
Niggas playin' crazy, catch a headshot
I don't need red dots, I just aim then pop, ask [?], I don't shoot leg shots
I just cock that Glock, focus in, then watch
Lemon squeeze, that nigga gon' drop
[Chorus]
You ain't talking 'bout us
'Cause my team gon' bust
Turn bitch niggas into dust
My gang too rough
We gon' leave niggas stuck
Put a nigga face in the mud
You ain't talking 'bout us
'Cause my team gon' bust
Turn bitch niggas into dust

We gon' leave niggas stuck
Put a nigga face in the mud

I got shooters on deck that'll get a nigga wet
Go stupid, go crazy with the Tec

Have 'em put you to rest, hollow tips, they'll chew through a vest
We ain't never been to school round here, lil' nigga
But you can take another test
My niggas gon' shoot, push his soul through the roof
Fuck niggas better move if you know what's next
Can't fuck with my squad
'Cause my gang gon' bang, shoot a nigga point-blank, close range
And they know we go hard
We be the gang they can't tame, so you best bet stay your lane
We'll pull your card, rob you and your mains, tuck chains, and we takin' everything

'Round here we don't play, shootouts with the opps broad day
Mistletoe gon' kiss, my bullets don't miss, wet a nigga up. stank like piss
And I ain't mean don't trip
Slide back to the dip, just drop me a opp on the strip
Like big [?], have a nigga so Crip put a little bit of red on that fit
You wasn't talking 'bout me

Whole gang gon' bust, turn you to pixie dust
Ain't no luck when we shootin' shit up, I'll shoot your bitch
If she wanna act tough, putting holes all through the red truck
Thought he was a hologram till his ass got touched
Like a blunt, I'll spark his ass up
Foe nem goin' ham, two times. same cut, popped out, fucked your whole block up

Bugün dışarı çıkıp bir kaç arkadaşla takıldım
Restoranda yeme içme arkanda da lakırdı (sonra)
Hafiften tartıştık parkta ancak barıştık (evet)
Gelecek kaygısız kavgalardan arındık (biz)
Bugün görüştük sevgilimle sahilde
Onsuz günlerde resmi hep kalbimde
Evine bıraktım tedbirle saatinde
Hızı saatte 150 ile takipte
Peşimdeydi birileri lakin fazla takmadım
Çoğaldığında mesafe tam virajda gazladım
Eve vardım vücudum ah bir anda kaskatı
Doldurdum viskimi az biraz rahatladım
Bugün güzel bir gündü herşeye rağmen
Garip işler başıma gelse de bazen
Sevgilim ve dostlarım benle beraber
Anlıyorlar beni ve bu dertlere çarem

Bugün dışarı çıkmadım çünkü fazla dostum yok
Olanlar sattı dün ve bugün sorgum bol
Hedefler belirsiz olsa bile noldun koç
Gelecek kaygısı buna dair korkum çok
Bugün ayrıldım iki yıllık sevgilimden
Çıkardım kaseti kırık tuşlu teybimizden
Kapattım gözlerimi olayları beynimizden
Onların istediği söylesene neydi bizden (neydi?)
Bugün öğle vakti kendime bir silah aldım
Değilim saldırgan ama yoruldum inan artık
Hergün tehdit var peki şimdi kim hatalı
Kendimi korumak mahkeme de biraz pahalı
Bugün düşündüm düşünmekten başka
Birşey yapmamışım bugün üzülmesem asla
Çünkü benim bedenime hüzün gelen fazla
Anladığını söyleyenler gülüp geçer anca

Por quem trazias ao teu lado, pensei: ""cara de otário""
Chillei pela festa naquela que não te vi a entrar
Fumei uma erva à janela só para não pensar (mas)
Pensei que é desta que a bela consegue-me enganar
Guardei o que resta da erva e voltei-me pro meu lugar
Sou apresentado, por quem nos tinha convidado
Faço-me de engraçado finjo não tar interessado
Mas tu ficas ao meu lado pa me fazer intimidado
Não largas os meus olhos e agarras o namorado
Seguro o scotch a pensar que sou mais forte

Lemme break it down for you
Summertime's over and it's back to school
Time to get excited about learning
What's up with that war in Iraq?

Yo, the bus rolled in and it's 7AM
The first day of school's where my story begins
My momma packed a lunch but forgot the chips
And my brand new pair of JNCOs got a case of the rips
Sat there for a moment seriously frustrated
Ate my lunch, went to class (but hated it)
It's the doo doo pants, and it's your boy like whoa
Couldn't hold it for an hour, positively no
So I prayed for the bell but it never came
My license plate says FRESH but my jersey says SHITSTAIN
Now I'm setting up for class like a dunce
Smelling like a dump truck full of dirty cunts

Mom took me to Wal-Mart and spared no expense
And I just can't wait to get my fash-on
I go to school to learn but looking good's my pass-ion
So here we go, it's Monday morning and I'm waking
I grab me some scrambled eggs and some bacon
Ran to the curb but the bus was late
Me and my momma had to regulate
So we jumped in the van, didn't waste a minute
Did I mention that my eggs had ham up in it?
Yo, my mom don't fuck around when it comes to omelettes
Everything that chick makes is pretty much the bomblette

[Marc M]
Yo, check it out
Lemme break it down for you
Summertime's over and it's back to school
It's time to get excited about learning
What's up with that war in Iraq? [x2]

[Stamper] (Marc M)
Man, summertime's over and it sucks to be me
Cuz I gotta go to classes I hate like P.E
Where the other dudes laugh at my inability
When it comes to any sports or physical activity
I gotta run around the track inthe back of the gym
But I walk cuz I'm fat plus I don't wanna swim
In the pool, in the gym, cuz the girls see my tits
And they point and they laugh cuz a dude has tits
Fucking bitch, I'm the bomb at computer shit
(Sluts rubbing up on my dick with MySpace questions)
And I'll keep you guys in check with my chess club buddies
(Steal my lockermate's shorts for the jack off session)
Gripping lunch tickets, everybody laughing at me
By the end of the day, I'll probably get my ass beat
Cuz I dress like a faggot playing Magic: the Gathering
The trading card game full of warriors and wizards
[Marc M]
Yo, check it out
Lemme break it down for you
Summertime's over and it's back to school
It's time to get excited about learning

Save that kind of feeling for another day

While I sit alone and you are playing
Like my brain is saying don't play that song today
Not while I'm trying to pack and get on my way
That kind of music can make a fiddler stay
I guess I could get up and I would walk right out the door
And maybe I would forget you before I reach the highway
But sometimes a loving look comes across your eye

I'm wishing I had met (loved) you later on in my life

Surrounded by these fucking voices
They don’t ever stop
They keep making noises
Tryna tell me things
That I don’t wanna hear
Focused on the end
I think it’s getting near
My temper with a gun
Yeah that’s all I fear
Keep talking that shit
And you gon see it clear
Pop a couple pills
And now I’m switching gears
Kill you just for fun
I’ll treat you like a dear

(Chorus)

Homie I suggest you change your tone
Your out of options
Voices in my head do not forgive
No they just pop shit
Labels will not sign me
They know Kraven way too toxic
Collecting body parts
I’m storing bodies into boxes
Boxes
Voices looking like a mosh pit
Mosh pit
Homie you ain’t bout to pop shit
Pop shit
Lately I’ve been on my pac shit
Dealing with these voices
Homicide is all I hear

3am trippin
Tryna continue living
Voices keep me up
But I don’t see no visions
When you dap me up
I’m sure you see me grinning
But little do you know
I’m out here really killing
Choppin and moppin
No photoshop I’m croppin
Tie your body up
And then we steady mobbin
Get you bloodied up

I ain’t talking Stockton

Doesn’t kill me first

Is this a another gift
Or is it a fucking curse

Kein Witz und kein Scherz, als Typ kann man verkacken
Ich bin ehrlich und ich lüge nich', ich fühl mich sehr erwachsen
Ich fühl mich zwergenhaft, ihr dürft ernsthaft drüber lachen
Ich hab Flaschen leer gemacht, statt euch mein Herz zu überlassen
Lass das Übel hinter mir, Brüder, künftig werd' ich's packen
Ich hab' 2 Nüsse im Sack und das Herz eines Drachen
Ich fliege übers Meer, such' den Stern mit 5 Zacken
Doch was laber ich von Flüssen wenn uns Berge überschatten
Unser altes Paradies ist ein leergepflügter Acker
Sagt mal alle über Chak, er wär sehr berühmt und tapfer
Es ist nachts und ich friere, verlier' meine Träume
Verlier' meinen Faden, verlier' meine Freunde
Ich kann hier und heut nix sagen bis die Wunden endlich heil'n
Ich fahr' nun heim mit den Bus, es tut mir unendlich Leid!

Doch es fühlt sich manchmal an, als wär ich fast dafür gebor'n
Doch mein Kopf ist ein Trabant, unglaublicher Gedankenschrott!
Ein schwarzes Loch im All, und mein Raumschiff wird angedockt
Ich steh unter den Wolken, wie ein trauriger Mann vor Gott
Ersaufe im Hip-Hop, mein Sound ist mehr Alkopop
Leute sagen viel, manche enttäuschten mich dann tief
In manchen Leuten steckt der Teufel und die Freundschaften geh'n schief
Manche lächeln und sind freundlich, das bedeutet, nix im Spiel
Sie war'n gestern schlechte Läufer, komm' auch heute nich' ans Ziel
Ein Deal und man freut sich, man packt sich vor Glück
Unterschrieben und dann häuft sich der Zaster wie verrückt
In meiner Stadt liegt mein Glück, ich war lange nicht dort

En paz descanse, de parte de Mr. Pomel
Po-Po-Pomel, es el Maracaibo, es el Babo, ese
Es el Babo, ese, Casa Bab–, Casa Bab–
Pura sangre malandra, para el barrio, pa-pa-para el barrio
En español, en español, Casa Babilonia Records
Ca-Ca-Casa Babilonia Records, ruido de la mente
Un tabacón, en español porque se oye más chido y chingas a tu madre, ¡que motherfucker!

[Verso 1: Mr. Pomel]
De repente en el cuartito pegaron el grito
Cuando Pomel llegó al micro, marihuano, drogadicto
Lo encerraron por maldito, mi expediente de ex-convicto
No me dejo trabajar
Pero ¿quién chinga'os me quita mi manera de cantar?
Al cato ni los trucos que me dio la policial
Me alejaron del desmadre, de la droga y la maldad
Pandillero original, nacido en la Caracol
Adoptado en Santa Marta y en La Aurora, ¿cómo no?
Maracaibo de por vida, nomás watchen mis pastillas
El placazo en tinta china
Con cuerda de guitarra estilo Santa Catarina
De cuando el Babo empezaba a rayar a la razilla

[Verso 2: Babo]
Pues yo no traigo Converse, pero mis Reeboks
A dos-tres raperillos ya les fruncieron el ligo
Porque un bandido de mi calibre
Tiene lírica que prende como combustible
No me chilles, que tú no eres pandillero
Lo que tienes de malandro, compa, lo tengo de güero
Así que checa al que te derriba el teatro
Pendejos como tú en 2-28 desbarato
Ya no hagan guato, pinches vatos, si son reculos
Opérense las tetas, chance y les consiga un chulo
Que los castigue y que los regañe
Porque al Babo del Cartel no ha nacido quién lo apañe
No se me dañen la cabeza queriendo competir
Porque de la M a la C, yo soy el mejor en free
Aléjense de aquí que su rap no vale verga
Si ya le chingué el mandado, le chingo toda la tienda

De Barrio Bravo a Santa Marta, ¿qué pasó?
Ni hablar, mi Babo, como en antaño
Los prendemos a tronco y en el suelo les damos baño
Vamos a hacerles daño, no importa que nos demanden
Que ellos y sus abogados vayan a chingar su madre

Let's go round the corner sally
For your services in the ally
You can admire my treasures
While I steal at your nethers
The sallies we say
Out on the seas while we're away
Oh they'll cost us our booty
But they'll keep us at bay
Yo ho ho that's how your story goes
The plots of you land hoes
To steal all our gold
All our chests being sold
To fill your cargo hold
You look so fine for just a dime so how much time do we have for the crime?

The sallies of the 7 seas
They're always gettin on down their knees
The sallies of the 7 seas
The greediest bunch of the caribbean
Round the corner sallies sho
We're allways keeping tallies on
The walls inside our galleys
Oh the cost to have you ho
Sallies are loverless
Wearing their wedding dress
Keepen off guard by the promise of faithfulness
Taken for granted these wenches demanded
We get on our ship and sail til we landed
On a mountain of gold and jewelse to be sold
Or that we disbanded until I commanded
A fleet of the largest galleons imagined
Oh you ho
Little do you know
That while we been sailin
I been hittin it on the low
Everyone knows
You never propose
To a woman in the throes
Of her passion for your gold

The sallies of the 7 seas
The greediest bunch of the caribbean

Oh the cost to have you ho
How many times
Has a man rolled that dime
On a wench with no substance, no blarney no blime
Round the corner we'll go
Wait a minute you ho
I can tell by the stench you've probably clenched a hundred seamen ye wench
Pearl necklace event, that's what ye'll get
After my payments been sent, just like I came I went
My cannon's been spent and I ain't no gent
How could you believe how could you conceive
That I would give you ten pence?!

J’ai ressorti la plume
Dessous le papier brule
Je refais le monde
Et sous les secondes que je consume
Le temps me consomme
Bloqué entre voyelles et consonnes
Réalise alors
Que l’or est le son qui me console
Quand la vie se corse et qu’elle te force
A rester sur le sol
Quelques clés de sol
Pour conjurer le sort
De bonne escorte
Mon son jaillit des baffles et te transporte
Apaise le mal qui te transperce
Verset médical
Et ta peine se veut ridicule
Tranche de façon radicale
Devant ce fléau minuscule
Je rallie la paix
Comme des fragments de molécules
Chimie lyricale
Sous la puissance des mots que j’articule
Remets ton casque l’ami
Jusqu’à ce que  le mauvais karma se casse
Mais dans tous les cas
L’unité est notre as
De bonne escorte
Mon son jaillit  des baffles et te transporte
Apaise le mal qui te transperce

Paix, unité et harmonie
L’ami, les seules épées que ma raison manie
Les Minos murissent au Sex, drogue et money

Ma peine grandit
Aux yeux de ces fous qui grandissent
Dans l’entourage avec un discours moins beau que ceux de Gandhi
Des dandy aux bandits du Rap
Le fond est triste comme Candy
Au rythme des caisses claires mon flow resplendit
Donc reste tranquille
Et kiffes donc la vibe
Et laisse le temps d’un kiffe ta haine en stand by
Musique universelle sans vice et sans adversaires
A chacun de mes versets
Le calme
Je viens déverser
Percer le mal et entrevoir la lumière bercer
Les visions qui ternissent la beauté de tes pensées
De bonne escorte
Mon son jaillit des baffles et te transporte
Apaise le mal qui te transperce

De onde vem esses olhos, essa boca
Gosto do cabelo, a pele que coisa louca
Menina mulher, todos te dão Ibope
Não canta, mas você mexe que nem a Jennifer Lopes
A gente gosta, mas mulher nem tanto
Ficam com inveja encostadas no canto
E na passarela só da ela, um arraso
Pra felicidades de todos os paparazzos
Com tanta curva o piloto tá na poli
Mais depois de um minuto perde o controle, dela
Nunca vi coisa mais bela
Pode tá calor mais a barriga gela
Chega essa bronzeada na minha praia é VIP
Essa eu vô chamar pra tá no videoclipe
E muitas parecidas tipo Coca e Pepsi
Mais nada se comprara com seu jeito sexy

Me faz ir pra lua mesmo sem ser da Nasa

Incendeia toda a festa e queima como brasa
No conceito de beleza ela segue na ponta
Ela é do tipo que o dinheiro não compra

Oitava maravilha que me deixa a mil
É um paraíso junto com a bela vista

E no jogo do amor quero chegar no céu

Eu vou te levantar bem no alto (é nóiz)
Cantar pra você na TV, rádio ou no palco

De biquíni cavadão ou de roupa nova
Vem cá com o Motirô, vem dançar
Gosto bem sexy pode me levar

Sapessi com'è casa mia
Adesso che non ci sei più
Vorrei quasi buttarmi via
Tu porti il tuo cane giù
Vai sempre a Santa Maria
La piazza che ci dice addio
Un russo canta ""’O sole mio""
Tu non sei più il sole mio

Che c'hanno fatto i filtri su
Come facevi tu
Magari è solo un déjà vu
Di un déjà vu di un déjà vu che ho avuto quella sera

Troppo falso che non c'era niente di più vero

Non ti vedo da quel giorno in quel fast food a Orvieto

And challenge rang unto the cloud

واللي كسرتيه بايدك صدقي ما حدا بصلحو
واللي عاش حب جديد ما بهون عليه فرحو
وضلك عم تكبري باسمي لأنو  صاروا باسمي يصرخوا
كبرتي مع اسمي مع أنك حاربتيه
تباهيتي بتراكاتي وقدامي رفضتيه
كنتي انتي السبب ورا كل تراك انشطب
وكنتي الوحي اللي ألهمني ورا كل تراك انكتب
والناس لسا بتسألني هادا  انتا ولا ال Fourty
ماعم اعرف شو الفرق دام ال Fourty قطعة مني
أنا اللي عملتا  وأنا رسمتا ولونتا بعد ما حرقتيها بنارك حتى صارت بتمثلني
حتى حروفي بتمل مني بتقلي ما شبعت عتب
وما عتب عليك Rhyme ولا عتب عليك أدب
والنتايج عم تختلف وكلن نتجو بنفس السبب
والمشاعر ماعم تنضب بعكس اي واحد كتب
وماني متل أي كاتب وحروف عن حروف بتفرق
هيي تألهمني وأكتبلا وغيري من سطوري بيسرق
وما حدا منن بصفي... وصدقني مين بيجرؤ
لأنو ما حدا بصفي... منن لو فكر يترك
كل النفاق اللي حولو ويحكي قصتو مع الواقع
كلو بيتقمص كلو مسجون بقواقع
فقاعة انفجرت من وخزة شوك الورود
تألمت من عطر الشام تسممت من هالوعود
ومافي أمل من هالنظرة ف بتشوفنا يائسين
ومهما طالت هالوعود ما كنا ناكسين
منضحك مع هاد الواقع بس من جوا بائسين
واللي لحقوا خطانا شموا فينا الياسمين

هي آخر صفحة من هالكتاب ....
ما بقي صفحات لأحكيها....
انتهت الرواية .....
بس لسا ما جفت الأقلام
هي الخاتمة ....

Dans le vrai,rap,Rohff,9762.0,"[Couplet 1]
Tenir un calibre vous fait bander
Quand il faut tirer, vous appréhendez
Juste pour les clips, vous vous branlez
Plutôt qu'un délit d'fuite, vous vous rendez
Vous n'assumez rien, vous allez planter
On supporte la taule, vous vous pendez
Toutes ces tapettes tapent la zipette
Inchallah, j'vous souhaite tous une O.D
Anciens du quartier ont fait leurs preuves
On s'est même pé-ta contre les keufs
On a le respect de tes grands reufs
On parle de nous au ballon comme d'Johan Cruyff
Du sang a coulé a en devenir fleuve
Tueur casqué, femme devenue veuve
Dois-je faire un dessin, putain d'chef d'œuvre ?
Toujours prêt, j'enchaine les épreuves
Que pour les vrais, le reste que du bluff
De la propagande mais les gifles pleuvent
Règlement d'compte, à part ça rien d'neuf
Bat les couilles, y'a grave de la meuf
T'embrouilles la tienne, elle me chouf
Elle bouge son gros uc', elle me chauffe
Pour une tof du sale en off
Y'aura pas d'love, que du Rohff

Pas d'leasing tout est carré
Broliqué, rien à déclarer, magnum de vodka à l'épaule
Les p'tits sont égarés, rappeurs s'endettent au poker
Pour s'asseoir à la table des youvs cramés
Vous n'êtes que des camés, j'ai quatre albums sans date
Ils veulent s'comparer, leurs carrières ne valent même pas 500 baht
J'ai l'immunité diplomatique de la street et ils pensent pouvoir m'abattre
Avec une kalash virtuelle dans toutes les ruelles, exploit individuel, j'encule l'rap actuel
Comme veut le rituel, le son est criminel, leurs musiques sensuelles, l'autotune bisexuel
Leur revenu annuel vaut pas salaire mensuel, d'un coup vous battez d'l'aile, votre sang pisse dans l'arène
Ça éclabousse la reine, j'reste égale à moi même, bon qu'à foutre la haine, phénomène médiatiquement énergumène
Clashé par des femens qui me ""ayin"", ils veulent stopper le règne mais ne mentent qu'à eux mêmes

Du kom til jorden uden rigdom
og afstod fra din himmelmagt.
På korset hang du som forbryder
og mærkede din fars foragt.

den vandt du, da du ofred dig.
I dåben blev jeg født på ny

Du lod mig føde som en arving.
Jeg blev et kongebarn som dig.
I dåben blev jeg gjort retfærdig,
du satte mig på livets vej.
Jeg regner intet her for rigdom.
For du, min bror, du er min skat.

Rap ist mein Centercourt
HB Erste Liga, ihr hingegen seid wie Rentnersport
Fahr mit Gangstern vor (Lass das Rumgeweine bitch)
Heul nicht rum, weil dein bester Schmuck 'ne Hundeleine ist
Von Yayo gibt es mittlerweile drei Teile
Maximalgewinne sind der Grund warum ich nicht durch drei Teile
Ficke deine Mutter vor euch schluckt die Nutte drei Teile
Kommt dein Vater rein, dann zerhack' ich ihn in drei Teile
Ich hab' gehört dass so ein Vogel mich disst
Er ist gelb vor Neid, ich hab' ihn in die Poren gepisst
Du willst Geld haben? Dann rat ich dir Hurensohn zu sparen
Du willst mehr Geld, doch es gibt keine Hurensohnzulagen
Kay, ich weiß warum du zittern musst
Nicht weil du an einem Zwitter lutschtst
Sondern weil du Bastard einen Splitterbruch bekommst
Ich bin Al Pacino in jung
Guck ich rap mein Leben lang, doch habe niemals gesungen

[Hook:]
Du hast Gangster hier und Gangster dort
Komm ich stell' die einen Gangster vor
Gangster heißt nicht betteln wie ein Penner schnorr'n
Gangster ist, wenn Totschläger deine schwule Fresse formen
Komm zum Centercourt
Komm zum Centercourt
Du hast Gangster hier und Gangster dort
Komm ich stell' die einen Gangster vor
Ich schieß auf Obama und das Pentagon
Gangster, wenn sich meine Kugeln tief in seine Fresse bohren
Komm zum Centercourt
Komm zum Centercourt

Deine Mutter ist 'ne arschgebumste Hafennutte
Eine Fotze die bereits zu Kindheitstagen blasen musste
Jetzt komm ich und fick die Nutte persönlich
Fick sie ins Gesicht und schrei sie an: ""Der Kunde ist König""
Für deine paar Verkäufe lohnt sich keine Plattenfirma
Prahl mit deinem krassen Körper
Aber ich bin Massenmörder
Merk dir auf der Straße zählt allein, was der Baba sagt
Fick die 31er, nein fick den ganzen Paragraph
Du bist der, der im Kugelhagel schluckt
Erst wenn der Pate kommt, weil ich die Szene blutig schlagen muss
Ich bin immer noch der Prollrapper
Früher war ich dieser ganz kranke Typ
Der ohne Skrupel durch den Zoll brettert
Heute läuft das Ganze besser, ich leb' in 'ner Villengegend

God London,pop,Duran Duran,176.0,"God created the world
The created the devil to blame for his mistakes
I closed the door of my hotel room behind me
It was like closing a chapter in the book of life
Outside, thirty floors below
I could hear the police using their sirens
Like wolve whistles to pick up young girls
On TV Oliver North his 15 minutes of fame
Ticking steadily away was being fuzzy about crucial events
Which had happened a year earlier- what a flake
But then who isn't
That was Reagan’s defense at least
The worst thing is how politics begins to leak into your life
Back in our innocence we used to simply stick two fingers up
Say ""fuck the Queen"" that was about all you had to say anyway
And then go back to the more important business of making music
So why was I sitting there feeling angry about covert operations
And illegal aid to the contras
I mean I'm not even American
But maybe we all are a little bit
And then I realized, it was just the thought
That in this particular democracy
And probably every other one in the world
There is somebody in power who thinks he is more right
Then all the people who put him there
All the people who for once in their lives took an interest
Outside the wind was howling the who-who's
From sympathy for the devil
Round and round the concrete hotel walls and corners
That was then- this isn’t",0.2777363872155547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Comical Genius,pop,The Dubliners,1533.0,"O a comical genius was thinking one day
How he'd jack up his job and receive handy pay
He did not like begging and work was too hard
So he got a bright notion to join up the guard
Diddly-i-dum diidly-i-dum diddly-i-dum dum day

Well he went up to Dublin, to the depot went in
Got a new suit of blue as bright as new pins
They drilt him, they drilt him, they drilt him so hard
The old sergeant proclaimed him a full fledged guard
Diddly-i-dum diidly-i-dum diddly-i-dum dum day

He was stationed somewhere near the town of Athy
On the roads of the district he kept a close eye
The girls they admired him as all brassers do

Fell in love with the guard and his new suit of blue
Diddly-i-dum diidly-i-dum diddly-i-dum dum day

Well the girls they would wink and they'd nod as he passed
O but this city guard had his eye on one lass
And this little colleen, she being a die-hard
She made it quite clear that she wanted no guard
Diddly-i-dum diidly-i-dum diddly-i-dum dum day
Well one time while on duty on a cold winter's night
Sure he caught her out cycling without any light
Where's your light, miss? Says he; for an answer says she

The Black Velvet Band,pop,Tommy Makem,88.0,"It was in the town of Tralee, an apprentice to trade I was bound
We had plenty of happy amusement to make the long evenings go 'round
'Till misfortune and ruin came o'er me, which caused me to leave from the land
Far away from my friends and companions to follow the black velvet band

Chorus:
And her eyes they shone like the diamonds, you'd think she was queen of the land
With her hair hanging over her shoulder, tied up with a black
Velvet band

As I dandered along on the highway, not intending to stay very long
I met with a sweet little damsel and she coming tripping along
A watch she pulled out of her pocket and slipped it right into my hand
On the very first day that I met her, bad luck to the black velvet band

Chorus

Before judge and jury next morning, the both of us we did appear
And the gentleman swore to the jewelry, the case against us, it was clear
For seven long years transportation, I was hunted to Van Dieman's land
Far away from my friends and relations to follow the black velvet band
Chorus

Now, come all you sporting young fellows, a warning be taking from me
And beware of the sweet little damsels that are hanging around in Tralee
They'd treat you to whiskey and porter until you're not able to stand
And before you have time to get sober, you're landed in Van Dieman's land

The wine of life which stole us light
May we gather might again and be as one
And to forever relish between joys
As we taste from the poisoned gift of love
As we taste from the poisoned gift of love

Forever young in a ground so cold
The splendour of your dance still there to be behold

Our legend is a sin in tongues
To eternal sleep, to trance we belong
We are none but an empty glance
Palid is your state of grace

To eternal sleep we belong

You're stressin' me out i'm just tryna find peace
In the studio gonna make some nice beats
Smoking out my mind I just wanna be free
Never selling my soul it ain't up for lease
She got in my mind not letting me sleep
Soon everyone will know about Sawyer T
But until that day comes you know that i'll be

Whats a school day to a drop out
Soon as we start to fall in love you gonna cop out
'member those nights we were sneakin' by the cops out
Just me and you in the room with no top now
All fun and games till it starts to get serious
We was just friends till the lust made us delirious
Front like I would wanna see the crew when it was just you
Lost all my material possessions and my funds too
Shit i can't dance but i can hear the one two
Usually i'm sober but i might just be off one two
Shit i might just be off one two
Damn baby maybe i'm just off you

She said we can only talk on school days
She got a fine ass figure with some sick braids
The way in school's got me insane
Messing with my mind fucking my brain up
I don't really know what to do with this
Lookin' in the mirror thinking whats next
The way she's treatin' me has got me pissed
All i do is stand here upset
Mary Jane in my brain making me reflect
I don't think i'll ever get over this

T.M.C.B. Things Money Cant Buy,rap,CantBuyDeem,38.0,"[Intro]

[Verse1]

I got to work on my cardio
This young heart of mine
Ain't good enough to see the world through my daughters eyes
I'm still a kid myself
I need to learn some shit
I should just burn me one
So I can get a grip
Done done a lot of things that I just can't let bother me
Walking this skyscraper tightrope
If I fall and don't float say buy to Deem
I'll never try to fly off the strength of my daughters wings
And I done stopped trying to clip my fathers wings
You don't know me dog so you don't owe me dog
So you don't owe me dog
You don't got to go searching your soul for me
I release you from all of the pain you caused
But don't you ever go asking for some dough from me
Meditation is the key, let your soul just be
Let your hue just show
Let your faith bench press
Watch your hopes undress
And all your goals just reach
Either go for broke or be mediocre
I got way to many examples of why that's wrong for me
I came through the door
Like no overcompensation
I ain't bring no hoes with....
[Hook]

Boy you out of diapers huh?
Everything's a cycle huh?
All the disrespect you sow you reap
Everybody wants to be the king of the hill
But the head must know how to be the feet
And your eyes should know how to see the truth
And your heart should know how to feel the beat
My your blood keep you tied to your roots
Put the right amount of water on your seeds

[Verse2]
I got to work on my cardio
This young heart of mines
Ain't good enough to see the world without a dollar sign
Nothing I want for free, I got mouths to feed
A piece of paper that tells me what my job should be
But that's not what I'm on
I just share my soul, so I don't sell my soul
But then again I do
So what you want from me
I ahh choo my flu
I just spew my germs into the open airways so comfortably
Mamma ain't raise no thug
Most of my role models was, we sold lots of things
Like windy city in December they don't got degrees
Taught me more than I learned in all of school combined
Pitter patter of little feet on my kitchen tile, reminding me I could relax at a different time
I'm a rolling stone only for rolling stone
Not {be}cause I'm chasing tail
I'm coming right back home
Ain't leaving shit behind
I write the script myself
I paint the picture fine
I always kiss and tell
So my lips won't touch cheeks
To skip ahead in line

Are you ready for the two skinnee likeness?
You gotta look hard to find
Cause we are not high profile
Can't catch us cause we go high speed mobile
So accept your fate
You're on the skinnee time
We're copping cold jams
As the riffage for the rhyme
We are the rap band
Who puts the band back in rap
So stand back
And accept the slap or our tunes
They line the table
Cause to the ears they're food
Easy to swallow cause they come pre-chewed
My rhymes are unsightly
I say them uptightly
But don't take me lightly
Cause we know you be sight we
Come to the stage
Rock the mic cause we like it
Got out of our cage
We got flaws we don't hide it
We're humble when we stumbe
Not a king of the jungle
Just tumble out the tunes
That you've never heard before
Hip hoppin
Hard rockin, foot stompin gore
You've heard us once, n
Ow you gotta here some more
We've got some business
That we got to fix
So we brought our skinnee posse
And our big fat mix
We got gainful employment so we don't have to rob
And if you buy our tape then we can quit our job
I ain't punching a clock
And I ain't wearing a tie
Gonna do the skinnee business
Till the day I die

Pay attention to my speakin
As I rock your intellect
Come get your daily dose
Like an oral contraceptive
Respect this
Cause I kill the I'll at they conception
Let the skinnee vibe as we strive for perfection
Use my tongue to kick it like Kung Fu, shinobi
Found the fiends were hounding me
Like Ahab to Moby
I don't have no time to waste on bug competition
Put it all into rhyme, even the sink in the kitchen

I go on and on
Until my mission is completed
Foes are defeated
Mistakes are deleted
It's the tower of my life that I'm trying to erect
Over the blueprints of my sould I'm the skinnee architect
So listen
Cause this one's for the people of the planet
We be brother and sister
Like Tito and Janet
I'm skinnee and I slam it
So please baby, please
With these I get my soul on
And then the skinnee's roll on

Like Skinnee business
Like no business I know
I got no business with that ho
Business

Gotta go

Taking my time gotta focus myself
Talking to god for the road outta hell

Goddammit oh my lord oh my god
Working on this music, man it should be my job
Said I’m going to the top
And I’m stacking collard greens
Giving millions to the people baby I’m improving my own thing
Eating up on good chicken bitch cause I did it by myself

I cannot fold in the crunch time
I rise up to duel with the devil

Stoplight,pop,Sam Hart,284.0,"When the light turns green I'm gonna run for Mexico
And leave behind my precious little things
Even if nobody's here to watch me go
I will show no signs of wavering
But you can stop me any time
With the palm of your hand in mine
Oh, you can stop me any time
With the red light in your eyes

When the light turns green I'll find a way to disappear
Blend in with the crowd and fade away
I'll change my name and do my best to grow a beard
You won't find me hiding in the light of day
But you can stop me any time
With the palm of your hand in mine
Oh, you can stop me any time
With the red light in your eyes

Sometimes love is not the answer, it's the question
Sometimes leaving is the only way to know
So I will run as far as it will take me
'Cause looking back will only make me slow
But you can stop me any time
With the palm of your hand in mine
Oh, you can stop me any time
With the red light in your eyes
Oh, you can stop me any time
With the palm of your hand in mine

I Love You Oddly,pop,Rebecca Angel,54.0,"[Verse 1]
The only thing that I dream of
Is for you to be dreaming of me
And the only thing that I long for
Is for you to long obsessively

[Chorus 1]
Doesn’t everybody want to be adored?
Sometimes that’s all we’re looking for
Even though, I know
There’s so much more to love

[Verse 2]
I try not to laugh at the people
Who think love is a beautiful dance
But she keeps losing the rhythm
And he got a rip in his pants

[Chorus 2]
It’s keeping together stroke by stroke
In the sea of possibility
And trying not to let the other drown
We get distracted so easily
[Whistling & instrumental]

[Verse 3]
This is a very strange love song
But, hey, it was written by me
And if there’s one thing you’ve learned by now
It’s I love you, but oddly
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, but oddly",0.5852128006517887,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sic Transit Gloria,pop,Frida Hyvnen,157.0,"I'm older than the moon
And twice as wise
But I keep myself together
As I make way through this crowd
For if I would breathe out
I would sweep everyone of there high, high heels

Now won't you please use me for my soul is grand
My brain's partly ?
And I'm excellent in bed
Let's forget about tomorrow and the price upon my head
Let's forget

And let us dance
All stiff and athletic
Over us the moon surrounded with stars
The consequent ascetics
Stand out so young, so fresh and modern
Next to the fading glory of all things living

Things in the world
You divide them in three
It's the light
It's the dark
It's what comes in between
My love I'm afraid we belong to the latter
Destined to dwell in the midst of all matter
Days are like islands
And nights are like oceans
Fortune and fame come and go with the tide
As there's virtue and vice
And love and denial and regret

And here we dance
All stiff and athletic
Over us the moon surrounded with stars
The consequent ascetics
Stand out so young, so fresh and modern
Next to the fading glory of all things living",0.896958232333418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I walk up in the bank, they call me Tony Montana
Houses in Ohio, California, Atlanta
Said I was gon' quit, I'm sneakin', drinkin' dirty Fanta
All in my Porsche, my Escalade or my Phantom
Hate me a good bitch, I love me a dirty dancer
Fallin' out in Chanel, throwin' them temper tantrums
House that I built from ground up look like a mansion
Way I'm gettin' money I should live off in the Hamptons
My cousins in the trap, they wearing blue bandanas
I'm out in San Francisco throwin' passes, Joe Montana
I'm Tony of the trap, my nigga stole from me
I should've killed the bitch, I just stole on him
I'm Money Making Mitch when I'm up and down the interstate
I'll kill you cockroaches, 'specially 'bout my dinner plate
My drip come from Europe, your shit come from China
This rap shit don't work, my bitches still got vagina, ayy

I can whip it for you, come back yellow, macaroni

Pullin' up in a Phantom, jumpin' out in pajamas, ayy

Got a nigga 'round the corner, got a nigga at the door
Got a nigga in the kitchen while I'm whippin' up these O's
Man he just ran off, the nigga right back for more, hey
Tony Montana, I'm the king of the yard
Loudest nigga in the room dressin' like Nicki Barnes
Flood the hood Tony style, it was high in demand
I was supplyin' the man, that's supply and demand
I had that Tony Montana, it was pure as can be
It was jumpin' like Jordan, man, this shit took a three
Got to goin' so hard I won the trap MVP

Порезы Cut,rock,22 years,9.0,"Хочешь верь
Хочешь нет
Билет в один конец
Стою в окне

Оглянись и найди
Подтеки крови на лице

За спиной пустота
Впереди я вижу свет
На руках сколы глаз
Куда ведет скажи

Все вокруг
Будто сон
Даже в нем нажал на стоп

Вроде шел со смыслом
Не могу найти его

Образ жизни от понимания до смерти
Низкий потолок меня
Заставит резать мои вены
В тебя я весь, как монастырь, в который ходу нет
Несу вестей, стою на перекрестии путей
Какой протест даст волю и силы на прогресс
Завет внутри, меньше объяснений
Откуда все взялись

Больны людьми, им абсолютно наплевать
Жесток наш мир, разрезает горло по частям
Я отвечал, казался вежливым твоим чертям
По тем ночам ходил, как сонный, по тем изученным местам

Хочешь верь
Хочешь нет
Билет в один конец
Стою в окне

Оглянись и найди
Подтеки крови на лице

За спиной пустота
Впереди я вижу свет
На руках сколы глаз
Куда ведет скажи

Все вокруг
Будто сон
Даже в нем нажал на стоп
Вроде шел со смыслом
Не могу найти его

Образ жизни от понимания до смерти
Низкий потолок меня
Заставит резать мои вены

Сделал, как хотел
Мечтал об этом много
Ты сделал, как пиздяй
Тут слишком много копий

Буду тратить время
Изменяя поколение
Мозг несёт идеи
Говорю, что будут достижения

Не люблю людей
Навечно буду одиноким
На руках несу
Кучу строк моих далёких

Умыться бы в слезах
Из-за которых я свободен
Учиться бы любить
По-настоящему, без боли
Рисую на холсте
Размеры мира - не предел
Не сойти с ума
Причины веские, поверь

Тот же, что и был
Другим уже не стану
Рвёт нас на куски
Когда калечат нашу правду

Хочешь верь
Хочешь нет
Билет в один конец
Стою в окне

Оглянись и найди
Подтеки крови на лице

За спиной пустота
Впереди я вижу свет
На руках сколы глаз
Куда ведет скажи

Все вокруг
Будто сон
Даже в нем нажал на стоп

Вроде шел со смыслом
Не могу найти его

Образ жизни от понимания до смерти
Низкий потолок меня
Заставит резать мои вены",0.265214204788208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L'autre jour à Jénine
Quand tu criais ""pourquoi ?""
Devant tes maisons en ruine

Un soir à Tel-Aviv
Quand ta jeunesse a dansé
Jusqu'à ce que mort s'en suive

Je n'y comprends plus rien
As-tu vécu le pire
Ou n'est-il que pour demain ?
Est-il fou d'espérer
Voir un jour sur ta terre

Se penchent enfin sur tes plaies

Weil das nicht mein bereich ist
Stell ich keine fragen
Und bitte dich nichts zu sagen

Oder wie die arbeit ist
Was du für mich bist

In a whole 'nother life, there was this boy that I knew
He made me feel like a woman
We were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band
Wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like

Tumblr Post,misc,Lauryn Hill,2357.0,"It has been reported that I signed a new record deal, and that I did this to pay taxes. Yes, I have recently entered into an agreement with Sony Worldwide Entertainment, to launch a new label, on which my new music will be released. And yes, I am working on new music.

I’ve remained silent, after an extensive healing process. This has been a 10+ year battle, for a long time played out behind closed doors, but now in front of the public eye. This is an old conflict between art and commerce… free minds, and minds that are perhaps overly tethered to structure. This is about inequity, and the resulting disenfranchisement caused by it. I’ve been fighting for existential and economic freedom, which means the freedom to create and live without someone threatening, controlling, and/or manipulating the art and the artist, by tying the purse strings.

It took years for me to get out of the ‘parasitic’ dynamic of my youth, and into a deal that better reflects my true contribution as an artist, and (purportedly) gives me the control necessary to create a paradigm suitable for my needs. I have been working towards this for a long time, not just because of my current legal situation, but because I am an artist, I love to create, and I need the proper platform to do so.

The nature of my new business venture, as well as the dollar amount reported, was inaccurate, only a portion of the overall deal. Keep in mind, my past recordings have sold over 50,000,000 units worldwide, earning the label a tremendous amount of money (a fraction of which actually came to me).

Only a completely complicated set of traps, manipulations, and inequitable business arrangements could put someone who has accomplished the things that I have, financially in need of anything. I am one artist who finds value in openly discussing the dynamics within this industry that force artists to compromise or distort themselves and what they do, rather than allowing them to make the music that people need. There are volumes that could (and will) be said.

La Muerte de Fausto o Cuando el Rascal Conoció a Claira,rap,Ghouljaboy,130.0,"[Letra de ""La Muerte de Fausto o cuando el Rascal conoció a Claira""]

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Aye! yeah! wow!

Quiero que seas mi alarma
Si no despierto mañana
Vente que no tengo ganas
Ya ni contestas ni llamas
La casa sigue embrujada
Hoy no salí de la cama
Cuando salgo siempre un drama
Haciendo tropas con la banda

[KolomB]
Son fin de semana y no siento mi cara
Si lo vas a hacer hazlo y aistara
Posa posa para la foto y la cama, la cama
Lloro un lago y no un río
Siempre me escapo
Esto no es lo mío
Resistirme a ese puro es un desafío
Quiero que seas mi alarma
Si no despierto mañana
Tanto calor no tengo ganas
Ya ni contestas ni llamas
La casa sigue embrujada
Hoy no salí de la cama
Cuando salgo siempre un drama
Haciendo tropas con la banda
[Ghouljaboy]
Cansado de buscarte
Pero al final me encontraste
No llegues tarde
No he llegado con mi parte
Y el tiempo pasa para ambos
No me duelen ya los llantos
I don't give a fuck
Yo seré para ti
Lo que yo di fue para ti
Tú serás para mi
Lo que yo di fue para ti

[KolomB]
Tiempo al tiempo
Todo es lento
Mi caja de sentimiento
Porque en mi [?], bye lo siento
Si no lo digo reviento
Quiero que seas tu mi alarma
Ponernos junto hasta el alba
Fiesta [?] sin calma
Nena me sentiste el alma
Me sentiste el alma
Me sentiste el alma
Wa wa wa wa wa
[KolomB]
Quiero que seas mi alarma
Si no despierto mañana
Yo quiero verte en mi cama
Contigo no tengo ganas
Una base de lavanda
Al verte mi cara cambia
No necesito las xanax
Eres mi droga privada

[Ghouljaboy]
Baby soy el Rascal
La tengo pasta
Contigo me basta
Mami, tú me raptas
Yo no quiero un medio, te lo digo en serio
Quiero que tú tiembles
Nena, ya me entiendes
(Ohh, Ohh)

Yo seré tu chico guay
Tienes que ir por ti
Yo seré tu chico guay
Dime que me quieres a mi

Soy víctima de caprichos de María en mi poesía
Y tu palabras ordinarias de un retrasado paria que lamía
Puta del rap te ofreces con quien sea, tu mierda no es buena
Puta, después del encanto no vales la pena
¿Y que hay de mi y de ti? Nada
Huelo a los wacks como tu a kilómetros y hectáreas
Fluyo sobre este ritmo que es mierda mía
Valgo por mas de dos, tu y tu productor ¿ya lo sabían?
¡Claro!, están bien enterados de mi y eso no es raro
Aplasto al que ignora que tengo lo que he trabajado
¿qué? ¿no te sacan y estas amargado?
Sino quieres el poder de ser conocido no subas tu disco
Me suenas a excusa o falta de compromiso
Y también gusanos sangran cuando se pasan de listos
Hacía falta ver al piso y encontrarte
Comparar tu mierda con la mía, soy trayectoria y alevosía
Estaba en el pedo cuando no existías, soy tu contraste
Van a querer hablar de mi
Tu observando el paisaje yo soy un tsunami
Innumerables faltas de respeto a mi intelecto
¿te quieres colgar?
Ven a colgarte de esto, ven a topar mi mounstro
Que no me trago tu maldad ni tu nihilismo
Si eres un emo que se cree el anticristo
¿cuántos discos más sonando a lo mismo?
Come on Emily, soy tu exorcismo
[Chorus]
Cambiar de nivel no es fácil, es natural
La frase no es táctil pero te puede matar
Que cómodo es automarginarse, esconderse y no mostrarse
¿juegas con el fuego y no quieres quemarte?

Pasan los años y sigues siendo nadie
Me vez avanzar, quieres pararme

All the Nations,rock,Strung Out,260.0,"In London, in Brooklyn
By the side of the road in the rain
It's simple in this ghost town
Another set of eyes breaks me down again
I know there's something going on with my perception
I see the same face in every new direction
And every set of eyes tells me something I know about myself
But never seem to wonder

This breaks my heart, each time I see the woman I don't know
And all the nations tell me is we're all the same way

In Berlin, in DC
Going south on a cocaine train
A church yard, a back yard
Keeping on till we find our way home again

To all of the nations
And two light towns
In the airports and gutters
The eyes shout all the same
This breaks my heart, each time I see the woman I don't know
And all the nations tell me is we're all the same way

Together we go through it all and
We've seen it all and we're going nowhere
In life we can never try to break us down and
Get along

Together we sing along
In life we'll never be alone
In life we'll never be alone
Let's celebrate the space that keeps us from ever getting in
From ever getting in

This breaks my heart each time I see the woman I don't know
And all the nations tell me is we're all the same way

By the kids from the year above
Finding out that smart remarks
Don't help to mop up blood
And when they've finally tired of this
And they've all gone away
Someone comes and helps me up
And quietly says

""Leave my brother alone
Leave my brother alone""

He says ""Mark, if I was older
And if I had my bike
I would cycle after them
And challenge them to a fight""
I said ""James, don't you worry yourself
It's really quite all right
Sometimes it's enough to know
There's someone on your side who'll say
Leave my brother alone
Leave my brother alone""

Fast-forward fifteen years
And we're talking on the phone
About his stupid bint ex-girlfriend
Who has left him on his own
In the house they bought together
While she's out seeing other men
She's got the nerve to wonder why
They can't still be friends, and I thought

Leave my brother alone
Leave my brother alone

I said ""James, if I had a car
And if I could even drive
I'd dash straight up the M69
And give her a piece of my mind""

[Verso 1]
Eu não sei quanto tempo passou
Tu nem imaginas
Adivinhas ou palpitas quantos anos eu tinha
Demasiado novo para sair ao Comix
Então
Ficava em casa e imaginava tanta emoção
Tardes colado no caderno lá na Sé do Bairro
A mandar tags no rebordo dum projeto acabado
Acompanhado pelo 4x4 no flow
*Cypress Hill*, Beatnuts e bomba *KRS-ONE*
Não houve escolha
Eu tinha de seguir o rumo
Criar beats e mandar raps sob tarolas e bombos
Pegar na lata e à socapa bombar
Escapar à bofia e cuspir rimas contra o sistema [?]
Fui conhecendo gente decente
Que realmente fez algo por mim
E sempre estarei grato por isso
Instalou-se em mim o vício
E agora pago com gosto
Com mais um álbum a provar
Que rap tuga não está morto

Se todos tivessem a vontade
E fizessem aquilo que vão escrevendo
Talvez muitos ganhassem
Juízo quando invadem
Skills quando pintarem
Mensagem quando ""raparem""

Quanto mais
Onde quando comigo tudo aconteceu
Não foi apenas sentido
Foi muito mais que isso
Isto tem razão de ser

Quanto mais
Onde quando comigo tudo aconteceu

[Verso 2]
Éramos menos, mas humildes
Amigos e mais unidos
Animados e vestidos
Sem filmes e compreensivos
Tardes de improviso no Piso e à compreensão
Lá no tasco nos copos
No Pickwick e então
Senti a preocupação de manter a noção
Que hip-hop é festa e diversão
Ritmo e revolução
Pacífica, sem armas, com palavras entendes?
Com latas, mics, turntables e vinis a acompanhar os breaks

Se todos tivessem a vontade
E fizessem aquilo que vão escrevendo
Talvez muitos ganhassem
Juízo quando invadem

Quando pensava que o Sábado chegava
E que uma festa me esperava

Rolling over the crest of the hill like a jet-propelled job comes
Kurt-Kurt-Kurtis Blow

Our parties are def and the girlies are pretty
In the boogie-down Bronx town in New York City
Like the sun will shine in the summertime
I don't do no crimes 'cause I just rhyme
I drive a Benz and I got a lot of friends
Up on the Concourse where Tremont ends
Or Jerome Avenue or Gun Hill Road
The place where rap started in the days of old
Called the Bronx

Hey Moe!
I have the Power
Coitainly!
The Bronx is the place where the Yankees play
We fans have the fever to the break of day
In '76 we used to have big fun
Chilling at the club 371
Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Italians and Jews
Bronx River Casanovas and the Ninth Crew. (called)

I'll be a Bronx boy 'til the day I die

Her soft love made me strong

Her smile like the sun starts my day
The joy that she brings like the treasure of kings far away
But how can I keep you safe in a world full of violence

Adventure Time,rock,Diamonds to Dust,103.0,"The clock strikes the hour when a decision has to be made
A decision made by the life you held as you wither away

Now that the bill comes due, which gate will you walk through

Time evaporates into nothingness
Years down the drain and only a few remain
You will receive what you were promised
You will be afforded what you deserved
Either a crown of relief or a crown of torment

This war wages on in evеry single person the light and thе dark
But the dark will never prevail if you keep Christ in your heart
The inner struggles that you faced, did you ever give in
So either choose the darkness or destroy it with the full force of heaven

The illusions are tough to see through or was it by design
All of creation shouts the truth will set you free
Walking the tight rope between order and chaos
This game that is played is lost most often
Free will is the reality but you can't serve two masters
When seeking freedom do you know which king that you sought
This war wages on in every single person the light and the dark
But the dark will never prevail if you keep Christ in your heart
The inner struggles that you faced, did you ever give in
So either choose the darkness or destroy it with the full force of heaven

Somebody better call the ambulance or the E-M-T (Yeah)

Bet I roll up on a nigga with a G-M-C (Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat)
Get to clappin' on 'em, end of it, the E-N-D
Call the plug, tell him that I want at least ten keys

Couldn't walk in my shoes with a street stampede
Can't walk this way, I Run D-M-C (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Pack in the mail, I sit it down and it's crackin' the scale
Had to switch position from the kitchen, nigga, I was flippin' like a spatula there
Pretty Ricky with them bitches, when I'm hittin' long as a dread on spectacular hair
Here shit, light shit, white whip, open up it look like a packet of mayo
I'm back in Rodeo, fuckin' up the check and chuckin' up the set
And I'm back off the layover, pay-over way over niggas
No slumber but a nigga stay over, nigga
Your bitch is with me 'til the day-day, AK loaded up the same way
Chain swang, white person screamin' out, ""Gang gang!""
Slide or kick, Jet Li or Liu K-K-Kang (Wah!)
I got a Little B, he call me based God like brring, ding, ding
Got a main dame, Audemar, and that's my main thang
Got a Rollie watch, her name Jane but she plain plain, so we call her plain Jane
Over her, I let it bang-bang like the fingers twistin' on a gang member sittin' in the chain gang
Nigga, please, I got old nigga cheese, y'all got hoe nigga knees
Can't let a faux nigga roll up, put a hole in your shit then let the ho nigga leave, man
Y'all niggas know a nigga T-O-R-Y, all my niggas got paws and they're always for the free
""O"" for the fee, if a nigga throw a couple Gs, get a little nigga smoked for the free, man
1-5-0, first show, nigga, that's how I go, I was chosen with those melodies
Niggas hatin', I've been goin' up with those enemies
And the snakes keep blowin' it with those in the breeze
I'm up to no good, my boy's in the hood
With no young Jeezy, and no Jody Breezy, could blow 40 Gs
Still come back, who the fuck lookin' like the Ol' Dirty B from the Wu-Tang, nigga?
I could say nothin' on a motherfuckin' track, still go back plat' like Pootie Tang, nigga
Do your thing, nigga, hoppin' in the Mulsanne
Hotter than a blue flame lit up in the full tank, nigga
Man niggas better hide, niggas what, niggas what?
Nigga, niggas at the bottom of the food chain, nigga
Nigga so lame, can't crew hang, nigga, can't crew bang with ya, can't move a thang with ya'
See a little bad bitch walkin' down the block, but she lookin' at me 'cause your crew can't get her
I'm a dominator, moderator
Pass your chick like hot potato
Police non-cooperator
I won't tolerate a bitch that's talkin' crazy, not me, lil' nigga
I be on the beach with the sea, lil' nigga
I been triplin' up the doubles and threes, lil' nigga
Livin' it up with the women up in Vis, lil' nigga
Give it up all my niggas is tuckin', I hope a nigga's duckin'
I been drippin' and drippin' like a nigga's tippin' the bucket
I been whippin' these bitches and stickin' out my dick in public
They be lickin' a nigga to get to familiar fuckin'
I be fuckin' these women in ten-percent'd tinted windows
And I'm yellin' and tellin' I gotta get it, get to steppin'
I'm reppin' Umbrella forever, my niggas in abundance
I'm fly as propellers, you jealous
And if a nigga comin', I'm eatin' these niggas like ketchup and relish on a bun
I got the money to fund the wonders of what I wanted
And when I want it, I wanna feel like you can't front on it
I got your ex-chick and your next chick on a pole in my livin' room floor tryin' to dance all on it
As long as I can put my hands all on her, she said: ""Handstand, a handstand'' and landed on it
I said damn, had to put it in her head, I ain't droppin' no bread
This is not that Gretel and the Hansel story
Got a Coupe full of hoes and the hose in the Coupe
To the Lamborghini doors to the floors and the roof
When I'm goin' in the booth, I'm exposin' the globe to the truth
They be knowin', I be showin' up with proof
Any faux nigga, any ho nigga, any low Joe Schmoe nigga better know
When I unload Get Low, Get Low, Get Low like Lil' Jon and the Eastside Boyz, nigga
And my lil' bitch type thick, uh
Neck is freezy as a ice-pick, uh
Out of sect just like a high kick, uh
Niggas gonna copy my style like a right click
All of my dogs'll kill you like Mike Vick
Light that pistol, put that boy in a Heimlich
I was handin' them Ls to Joyner and Don for comin' out actin' too lightskin
Nigga, I'm back in the Bentley, applyin' the pressure
Spittin' bunch of flyin' and firin' embers
So fuckin' hot, you'd think I died in the desert
Came back to fuck up your entire endeavor
You tryin' me? Never; your squad will get shot if ya try and be clever
My diamonds forever, designin' and linin' a bed up
Then give 'em a choice: which one you want die with, the .9 or Beretta?
I'm sorry for being intolerant, I got this violent temper
I like when I'm cold, I shoot a nigga, make him die in December
You been a bitch, as long as I can remember
You sayin' that you're gang, them niggas keep talkin'
I promise I'll silence your members then quiet your temple
While firing bullets that fly at your mental and pry at your denim
I'll hire somebody to fire the jet up then get up and send a shooter that'll fly if you rattle
I promise I'm high on momentum
Might think it's a setup, but find me a nigga
Might line that nigga for the paper
Let the hitter get to foldin', origami the nigga
The Louie luggage bustin' down on ya nigga
But true we thuggin', no insomnia, nigga
I'm really a top 3...

No there's nothing gonna stop me

Bodhidharma Pacifies the Mind,misc,Wumen Huikai,5.0,"41. Bodhidharma Pacifies the Mind

Bodhidharma sits facing the wall. His future successor stands in the snow and presents his severed arm to Bodhidharma. He cries: ""My mind is not pacified. Master, pacify my mind.""

Bodhidharma says: ""If you bring me that mind, I will pacify it for you.""

The successor says: ""When I search my mind I cannot hold it.""

Bodhidharma says: ""Then your mind is pacified already.""



Mumon's comment: That broken-toothed old Hindu, Bodhidharma, came thousands of miles over the sea from India to China as if he had something wonderful. He is like raising waves without wind. After he remained years in China he had only one disciple and that one lost his arm and was deformed. Alas, ever since he has had brainless disciples.

Why did Bodhidharma come to China?
For years monks have discussed this.
All the troubles that have followed since
Came from that teacher and disciple.",0.37594807147979736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

See Me Like This,rap,PROSE,1268.0,"{Verse 1]
Wake up, by this mic [?]
Come to visit for a minute
I heard you've been admitted ’cause your liver's gonna give in
I told you if you didn't quit this shit you’re gonna kick it
And if it wasn't drugs then the drinking would've did it
Still I ain't here to lecture you
I know I've done enough of that
I'm here to say I love you still
I'm hoping that you'll love me back
All that stuff at pointing tracks [?]
It’s because I’ve just been mad
The way you didn't raise me man
You ain’t been good enough a dad

I don't hate you but it's just the facts
I shouldn't have to be ashamed of you, but I am
It’s easier to blame when you're in pain
But I don't understand why you having a baby
Didn't make you try to become a man
It wouldn't be the same if you were taking up another path
What would it take for you to change?
I always wondered that
Now I see you as your life
You never stood a chance
But bringing up the past ain't gonna get my mother back
[Pre-Chorus]
As you laying in your hospital bed
Going over what the doctor has said
You offered your apologies and
I said don't worry and to follow you said:

[Chorus]
""I didn't want you to see me like this
I never knew this town was so small
Back when I didn't even exist
I thought you weren't around here no more""

[Verse 2]
The day I met my son it really sunk in
I ask myself ""How come you didn't love me like I love him?""
Did you not get the same feeling inside
From my eyes is a [?] his the minute I look in
Similar footprints and never leaving his life
Like the ones left in mind from the figure I put my trust in
Tell me why you'd let the drugs win?
Wasn't there something that said that I was a good thing?

I think it's time you started telling me the truth
About what happened in the past that was so terrible to you
To leave a family behind
And live a life that was heroin infueled
[Feel free to finish it off]

[Pre-Chorus]
As you laying in your hospital bed
Going over what the doctor has said
You offered your apologies and
I said don't worry and to follow you said:

I never knew this town was so small""

Esco truce da sta merda sotto i ponti di sto club
Cammino sopra la tua testa sull’asfalto con sto rap
Con il sangue della crew con le bambole voodoo
Con il 666 tatuato sulle labbra di Gesù
Bevo solo questo rum in ste notti marcie
Non mi salvi neanche tu da ste notti lercie
L’odio mi bussa alla porta di casa
Di notte mi abusa mi usa e mi sbava
Mi nutre di sangue e di odio profondo
Tanto quanto basta per uccidere sto mondo
Mi fumo sto kilo settimanale più la bustina
Mi rollo un po’ d’odio riempio questa cartina
Mi sveglio di notte esco e torno al mattino
Ti riempio di botte e fumo questo purino
Dai non pianger per sta merda resta con i piedi a terra
Son pronto per la guerra c’è l’ho in testa più dell’erba
Per sti froci nati ricchi che non sudano per l’oro
Noi per strada fatichiamo ad arrivare al giorno dopo
Nulla è facile qua giù ma ti cucisco quella bocca
Fino a quando c’avrò fiato in gola e la mia ora scocca
Guarda come vivo sta attento a sta contrada
Fai prima a star zitto riga dritto per la strada
Se vuoi uscire con me tu finisci male
Avvisa l’ambulanza che ti faccio collassare
Quando torni trovi casa invasa da sta gente evasa
Ti rubiamo i gioielli di famiglia per pagar la brasa
E scusa se mi siedo e mi giro una cartina
La mia musa viene fuori quando bevo codeina
Così rinasco t’inseguo e ti porto alla follia

È un viaggio contorto per ritornare qui già morto e risorto come in survivle
Fumi northen io morte fai notte io rotten
Ossa rotte spezzate polverizzo le vostre cazzate
Mi fumo una canna per ogni compare
Per ogni infame che sta a rosicare
Fumo i vostri giudizi dentro questo braciere
Carico bene giusto per farmi piacere
Bevo avocado con l’avvocato in commissariato
Il nemico è lo stato nemico giurato da quando sono nato
Me l’hanno insegnato fotti lo stato con il medio alzato
Fregati degli altri pensa a te che sei salvato
666 abbandonato in questa zona morta
Corri in questa giungla di cemento e dopo svolta
Arrivi alla porta della morte e dimmi chi sei
Fammi uno squillo che passo la sotto  digita 666
Se ci sei porta calma dell’odio ho un colpo in canna
Te lo spingo forte in fronte giusto per un’altra condanna
Adesso guardami dritto nei miei occhi di ghiaccio
Dimmi se lo faccio ti cola il trucco da pagliaccio
Sto mondo ma scassato il cazzo e ancora grido
Sto mondo non mi ha dato un cazzo manco un sorriso
Sto mondo mi ha tolto tutto pure il respiro
Eppure ancora vivo sotto effetto sedativo
Fatti un giro da ste parti che ti spiego un po’ sta storie
Vieni nella zona morta senza infami e troie

Что успеем? Chto uspeem?,rap,Centr,491.0,"[Текст песни «Что успеем?» ft. Стриж & Fame]

[Куплет 1: Птаха]
Птаха, Стриж, Fame, Slim. ЦАО
Я такое видел (было), я это знаю (точно)
Как судьба душу с сердцем выдирает, когда близких теряем
Таем перед злом
Маски добра, стебём чужую боль:
""Чё ты как тряпка, а? Не кури, не пей.""
Потом скулим как суки, охуевая от своей
Каждый день встаём, ноги в тапки, сигарета
Потом зубы, щётка, душ, штаны, кофта, куртка
И до палатки пару банок пива похмелье снять
Проснулся, а город спать
Нужно кинуть на мобилу лаве, позвонить семье –
Хотя потом, не до этого мне
Нужно понять, решаем проблемы, в игры играем
Живём, времени не замечаем
Бухаем, нюхаем, тусуем, стебём
Короче, жизнь жжём (короче, жжём)
А тут мысль: мне тридцон
Что я создал и создам ли что потом?
Стоп! Нужно рассудить. По полкам все расставить
Звонок отвлекает: Птах, я дорог тебе тут пару оставил (супер)
И всё снова: студия, курево, порево – как в кино
Хм, даже смешно
[Припев: Стриж и Птаха]
Употребляем что-то для здоровья и для бодрости
Жалеем о годах на высокой скорости
Горят как звезды лучшие, о них слагают повести
А что успеем мы на высокой скорости?
Употребляем что-то для здоровья и для бодрости
Жалеем о годах на высокой скорости
Горят как звезды лучшие, о них слагают повести
А что успеем мы на высокой скорости?

Очередная осень дождями моросит
Седина появится, как пить дать, не спросит
В тепле мои ноги, крепок сон, дышу ровно
Не примеряю лавры, не накопил и евро
Пора обзавестись семьёй уже, остепениться
А я от крови на одежде не могу избавиться
Ловлю отходняки от голландского фена
За семь шалава с опытом на раз пропалит тему
Дело прошлое, больше глупости, лишнее
По счетам долги, разлей коньяк в стопки
Ночью пару новых строк появится в тетради
Я бы убивался ей, но нет такой леди
Радуют, ей богу, золотые купола Круга
На груди крест, не плету интриг, просто
На будущее строишь планы? Не гони, братка
Нас таких особо жалует Россия-матушка
[Куплет 3: Slim]
Что успеем, а что уже успели?
Стоять до последнего? Бить сильнее?
Иметь мнение и никому не верить?
Открывать двери без разрешения?
Подымать деньги? Спать в понедельник
Не понимая за окном ночь или день?
Шурша по снегу шинами Michelin
К пацанам, а там весело посидим
И вспомним тех, кто не дождался этой зимы
Затупились ножи о чью-то жизнь
Темные улочки родной Москвы
Мы взрослели как могли
Прожигали и жгли, слезам не веря
Не своим, не слезам родителей тем более
Собою были довольны, стоя в холле
Вытирая кровь – правая рука ноет
На подоконнике ночью нормально кроет (пиздец)
Куда делось то, что было любовью?
Забей, она того не стоит, раскатай дороги
Да поровней. Ну, короче, ты понял

[Припев: Стриж и Птаха]
Употребляем что-то для здоровья и для бодрости
Жалеем о годах на высокой скорости
Горят как звезды лучшие, о них слагают повести
А что успеем мы на высокой скорости?
Употребляем что-то для здоровья и для бодрости
Жалеем о годах на высокой скорости
Горят как звезды лучшие, о них слагают повести
А что успеем мы на высокой скорости?
[Куплет 4: Fame]
Заведомо не постигаемы нами те пути
Которыми не хотим идти в невидимый негатив
За путаной бегать – не мотив; забыли мы, жизнь прожигая
Потеряно времени бескрайнее
Не понимаю, где меня носило
Силы были, мы летели, миллионы мыслей топили
Пили, кутили, мутили воду, ставили на кон свободу
Судьба сыграла с нами грустную ноту
Скажите, зачем была нужна эта пьянка?
Упала планка, в СИЗО давили танками
Души ваши – кандалы. Эти вандалы
Не передали хлеба, чтобы вы с голоду падали
Неделями позже судья дело выяснил
Дают условно с подпиской о невыезде
И вроде всё путем, да только грустно так
Что после этого в вас умерла музыка

Продолжать это стоит или прекратить?

That Night,pop,Jaret and Kelly,45.0,"[Verse 1]
I never thought that I could find somebody so absolutely perfect for me
We met outside the Troubadour ‘cause neither one of us could get in for free
You bought us pizza and you held my hand and we almost got hit by a car
You took me up to the hills that night just to look down on the stars

[Chorus]
We fell in love that night
Underneath moonlight

[Verse 2]
Drove the 101 to Malibu and fell asleep to the ocean sound
I saw the sunrise with you in my arms and traced our name in the sandy ground
I sat quiet on the ride back home just wondering if you felt the same
Had you proposed to me, I would have said ""yes"" even though that seems insane

[Chorus]
I wished you'd say something
We both said nothing

[Bridge]
I wish I could call you
I had your number in my phone
Why won't you call me?
What could I have done so wrong?
I should have written it down ‘cause I turned around
It was on the ground and wouldn't make a sound
You were fooling around, I might as well have drowned
I'm coming unwound, I'm in the lost and found

Staying Conscious,rock,Alchemist (Rock Band),74.0,"When the first single cells, felt the first rays of light
Carbon beings in process leading to life that we have today
A billion years later, technology springs
Exploding progress pushes is forward
But exploring progress is tearing us down
What is fiction is fact
There is no blame for conditioning
Reality's created by ourselves
We're to blame for our problems
Cells of our shells, merge with the earth
Becoming separately involved, composting, transgressing
In order to embrace life and death, we must eliminate
The boundaries that lie between the physical and the spiritual
Symbiosis, a two way process
People read their lives and then create their psychosis
Staying conscious requires effort
Evolution re-awakes the primal subconscious
Aware, awake, alert
Know or felt by ones inner being
Flow and slower, observer and observed
A wave, infinite ocean
Life and death in cyclic motion

You have an ego and mind
It's a useful part of you but it's not you

Dusro ko deta mai kabhi bhi sir dard nahi
Jaag ja tu nind se dikhade aaj dunia ko

2013 wali baat cheet raat beet jaati likhne baitha geet koi nahi tha meet haar jeet ka koi game nahi
Bas pata tha panne mujhko 8 bharne 14 bharne chaiye tha fame nahi

Janvari ke din varsh 2014 khoja khudme ek likhari jisne subah shaam socha jisne subah sham dekhe bade bade sapne bade bade kaam aiso aaraam kandho pe 8th vi ka bhoja

Kalam mere sath thi na meri koi aukaat thi
Socha likhte rah tu geet ek din aayegi kranti
Mehnat wali baate mujhse puchke tu dekh
Vo pasina yaad aaye meri ankhe bhar aati
Dennis bhai sath me likhte the kuch raat me
Subah the sunaate mujhko pen leke hath me
Hasta hun mai apni harkato pe kaur b ke
Liye album dennis bhai kya apko yaad hai

Tab umar thi 12 nahi tha koi bhai chaara
Bas 2 bhai sath baaki 2 dost or
Vo yarana vo tha time purana
Mai likhne ka tha us waqt se bhot hi diwaaana

Shayari kalam se maine ek ek raat likhi
Utha ke kalam maine ek ek baat likhi
40 rap likhe maine baarish me kitaab bhigi
Socho us waqt mere dil pe hogi kya beeti

Ghar wali chat se tha bhot mera naata
Kyonki rap ki kitaab saala vahi bhul aata
Fir yaad aata lene jaata leke aata bhulunga na
Yahi karta tha mai har roz khudse vaada

Kuch ni pata tha kaise kare ham record
Fir mila audacity bole oh my god

Anjaane the jo kal jisne pakdi thi kalam

Now before I start rapping, I must warn ya
I just washed down two mushrooms with some orange juice
I was thizzin' when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
It's just one of the many dumb flows of Dre
I'm tryna see G's, play these hoes like CDs
Old school like the Bee Gees
Give me green and some Whеaties
You don't want to see these, I don't givе no freebies
Ho, this dick cost, what you thought I fucked was ten ki's
Remy, it's in me, bring me what you got
Then baby maybe I'll love you like my two Glocks
I'm too hot, I do not, fuck with no havers

With a all black hat, and a fat bomb sack, bring heat just like a bullet

To girl, this dick's a no-no
So I picked up a bottle of Captain Morgan's, took her to the mo-mo
I had to hit the cho-cho
Boy, this ain't no ho stroll
But in my town these girls get clowned like they first name was Bobo
Can't shake E, or break E, stay around like a 12-day hickey

Easy does it, is it was it
The black or white that Friday night
In those racist places - let's get it right
Ah to the maximum, and keep askin 'um
When the city gonna fix where the BLACKS are from
And every day around the way another one got
Bucked in his head - from a gunshot
No chance in advance for the ambulance
Cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
A brother died, the mother cried, it was a pity
But that's how it goes down when you're livin in the city

The deal was dealt - now your health is in question

It be easier to get past
If this bitch wasn't so bad
Now I'm caught up in a lost cause
Fuckin' broads
My girl's searchn' through my shit now
Which means I probably need to quit now
And I hope I never get caught
Fuckin' broads
Fuckin' broads
Fuckin' broads

[Verse 1: Cee]
Yeah, now I ain't tryina be misogynist
But y'all make it too easy for me to talk some shit
And yo I gotta tell my girl this ain't about her
This some shit that I've been dealing with for a minute without her,
And dog, I'm talking model broads
Game strong, like getting into their drawers something I ain't needin a bottle for
Sending me nude pics like 'I ain't usually do this'
Either I'm fuckin cupid or half of these dudes is clueless,
Listen, Facebook chat, hit em on the friend add
Get a chance to mack and I'mma turn that broad to friend ass
Shit was easy but it's empty with the sex thing
Homie, most of these chicks is doing my fuckin' head in, aaaand
[Hook: Miguel]

[Verse 2: Notion]
Goddamn why you actin' like this again?
You like Cartman's doll, Polly Prissypants
Caught up in your dreamland with your silly friends
Bought it all at the mall but you don't make no ends
Ooh, you so materialistic
And you say you do yoga, well show me the splits bitch
Give me that attitude, go upstairs in a badder mood
I was chillin' on the couch, your housemate had to do
But boo, you've been off of the wall lately
Screamin' and all crazy, tell me what's goin' on baby
But you shut me off like a light switch
So I'm sayin 'Aight, peace!' and fuck off bitch, fuckin' broads

[Hook: Miguel]

[Verse 3: Cee]
Yeah, now I ain't tryina be a chauvinist
On the real, I'm just telling it how it really is
Broads are shadier than dudes be
So it's really hard for me to trust a woman, 'specially if they club freaks
It's either them or they friends is
Confused little girls figure that's where the mens is,
Mind is kinda small but they cleavage stupendous
Smarten up, ya looks ain't payin the rent bitch
I'm sayin though, yo, there I go, thinking with my dick again
The old me deaded coz I ain't tryina see her dippin kid
I got a partner and I'm grown so I done moved on,
But I gotta thank the chicks who inspired another rap song, and uhhhm

Everybody Needs A Lover,pop,Timothy B. Schmit,78.0,"(t. b. schmit/w. jennings/b. gaitsch)

Sadie made it down in hollywood
She worked real hard and she did real good
Now the years are finally coming down
Oh, though she owns this whole town

She's living and she's dying
She spent her whole time trying
Seems like even when you do it
Then you find out you can go right through it

Everybody needs a lover
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs a lover
To keep them moving 'til the end

Had it right down in his soul
Still has to face the day
Oh, some blues won't play

He's spent his whole life trying
Seems like even when you do it
Then you find out you can go right through it

Everybody needs a lover
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs a lover
To keep them moving 'til the end

Buy the papers and I read them all day
Wonder when they're gonna blow it away
Working hard just to keep myself sane

Thrive,rock,I Am King,312.0,"Such potential wasted
On feeling chasing nothing

Czujesz to? Fatum,rap,Slums Attack,177.0,"[Zwrotka 1: Peja]
Szare życie i nadzieje na poprawę jutra
Nie chodzi o luksusy, ale niepewność jest smutna!
I sto razy gorsza od faktów dokonanych
Dużo problemów w życiu rozpracowanych!
Co się stanie to się stanie codzienności nowe formy
Szary koloryt każdy jest od tego chory
Nie ugrzęznąć w gównie podstawowe zadanie!
To dla mnie jest ważne tak jak w gadce przesłanie
A socjolog znów powie, że dzieciaki zbuntowane
W związku z wiekiem dorastania, co on ma do gadania?
Życia nie zna, a przedstawia żywy dowód prostowania
Bo sierota już nie kradnie i w ośrodku jest fajnie
Beznadziejność ustroju brzmi to, co najmniej banalnie
(Bez komentarza!) W życiu różnie się zdarza
Raz nie mam, co jeść, więc się sprężam i narażam
Raz mam potąd wszystkiego, więc się dzielę z kolegą!
Komu co potrzeba? Jeśli mam to sprawy nie ma!
W końcu nie jest tak najgorzej, chociaż mogłoby być lepiej
To nie jest świat trzeci, reżim z chińskim pojebem!
A i tak, co parę kroków ktoś zalicza glebę!
Dać radę trzeba tak jak w starym kawałku
Ulice mego miasta pełne wyjebek i wałków
Luksusowe salony znane tylko z teledysku
Też chcę mieć więcej, więc dam komuś po psyku
To przejaw frustracji chwila stresu i po akcji
Wypchany skórzany farcik, finał bandyckiej napaści
Paragrafy mogą zawsze zrzucić do przepaści
Tak czy inaczej nie pobudzam wyobraźni
Nie wybiegam, co by było, bo wtedy się wymięka
Wchodzę na raz lub pasuję psycha klęka!
A sposób normalny, mogę zamiatać ulice
Firmowy kombinezon i firmowe nożyce
Strzyżenie trawników i bankomatowa karta
Taki myśli, że ma farta, ta robota gówno warta!
Bo ja dupy nie ruszając nigdzie na 8 godzin
Nie gorzej mam od niego, samo do mnie przychodzi!
Sposób niełatwy, ale zawsze plan bratni
W układach otwarty w peletonie lojalny
(Bez komentarza) radę daję to nie ściema
Jeszcze na koniec nie ryzykujesz to nie masz!
[Refren 2x]
Czujesz to to to? Widzisz to to to?
Czujesz to to to? Widzisz to to to?

[Zwrotka 2: Peja]
Bez przerwy śledzę ruchy, małolatów poczynania
Co ich do błędu skłania? Na duszy wieczna rana!
Dzieci same sie chowają, na to nie ma porównania
Bo boli i szokuje nawet mnie w kilku przypadkach!
Zaniedbania w rodzicielstwie, chyba, co druga sąsiadka (matka)
Ja wiem, każdy sie stara, jeden lepiej, drugi gorzej
Nieraz nikt nie pomoże, bo sam zrobić nic nie możesz
Bieda nie jest ciekawa 93 no i wcześniej
W życiu kłopoty odwieczne, strach przed końcem miesiąca
Sprawa wiele znacząca, gdy osoba tyrająca
Nie może spać po nocach topiąc smutki w alkoholu
I nie trudno do rozboju dochodzi, wszyscy młodzi
Każdy w konflikt z prawem wchodzi, bo inaczej nie można
Chcesz się mądrzyć? Weź zostaw
Nie żyjesz tak, więc spasuj
Masz w rozdaniu parę asów to sie ciesz!
Co innego Peja Wesz, ale nikt żółcią nie pluje
Życia mego nie żałuję, nie zamieniłbym na Twoje
Tutaj jestem, tu stoję, nie żadne przeboje
Ja wiem swoje, dodać projekt, równa się kawałek
- Dojeb! Mówi uliczny gnojek!!!
[Break]
Czujesz to, to, to

[Zwrotka 3: Peja]
Każdy pyta o więcej z tym sie identyfikuje
Ja wam rymów nie żałuję, tylko w jeden rytm celuję!
(Czujesz to?) Jeżycki klimat buduję! (właśnie)
(Widzisz to?) W nim najlepiej sie czuję!
Berlin, Paryż, Amsterdam, wiesz, że nigdy sie nie sprzedam!
Pojadę, ale wrócę, spokój jeżycki zakłócę
Znowu kogoś zbałamucę i frajera ryj ukrócę
Zawistny mówi, że smucę kiepskich zawsze pouczę!
Nawrzucam, gdy nie styka, nie potrafisz, to nie tykaj!
Nie zabieraj sie za to! Mówię do Ciebie szmato!
Zaniżasz poziom w mieście, dostałeś w ryj nareszcie
Na razie to przenośnia, stwarzasz problem, sadząca?
Szukasz kłopotów? Ja eliminuję wrogów
Bit, rym, pięść, cały czas jestem gotów!

Feeding Time at the Zoo,rap,Jehst,63.0,"[Chorus]
Yo, the animals got to eat
You know?
The wildlife needs to feed
So, yo
As the feral child struggles to grow
It's feeding time at the zee double-o

The animals got to eat
You know?
The wildlife needs to feed
So, yo
As the feral child struggles to grow
It's feeding time at the zee double-o

[Verse 1]
I need that home cooked goodness from the hands of the goddess
The golden sounds of the South Bronx projects
Rhymes like unidentified flying objects
Way over your dome I drop comets
Straight out of DC Comics
Marvel at my universe, I thirst for knowledge
Minds undernourished
IQ provide the brainfood
Bopping on street in a spacesuit
Moon boots and a fishbowl helmet
Cussing out life like, 'The bitch is so selfish!'
But that just ain't the case
It's the parasitic plague called the human race
[Chorus]
Yo, the animals got to eat
You know?
The wildlife needs to feed
So, yo
As the feral child struggles to grow
It's feeding time at the zee double-o

The animals got to eat
You know?
The wildlife needs to feed
So, yo
As the feral child struggles to grow
It's feeding time at the zee double-o

[Verse 2]
I need some good hot grub
But right now I'd settle for a foot-long sub
Heavy on the salad
Highgrade boiling my cabbage
Got the orange bud in the tupperware
Camberwell Carrot
My playboy bunnies going at it like rabbits
Wolf packs roam road totally famished
Water for the lepers
Walk in the street like hyenas in the desert
Emergency measures
Emerge with the [?]
Seek the oasis
The Playstation generation stays in a state of stasis
What's the basis?
Trapped in the zoo, fifty thousand baseheads
The apes are brainless
Faced with the monolith
I'm Kubrick, 2001 in this bitch
But, I'm bound to switch
And till now the plans gone without a hitch
We rob the rich, feed the poor
Puff trees galore
To build shit you've never seen before
Probably never see again
I'm getting very revolutionary when I'm moving steady with the pen
They ain't ready for the peng
Stop acting like a speng
Some dudes hunt food with a skeng

Yo, the animals got to eat
You know?
The wildlife needs to feed
So, yo
As the feral child struggles to grow

The way she holds him when they dance
She's the window to his soul, his best friend don't you know
You judge a day buy the sun, but you judge a man by the woman

You could spend all day, watch him work and play, get to know his habits and his friends
Learn what makes him laugh, and pry into his past, what makes him cry what makes him sing
You may think that you can see right through, oh but the best thing you can do is

Snow Tha Product - How I Do It Tradução em Português,rap,Genius Brasil Tradues,69.0,"[Verso 1]
Eu tenho um monte de dinheiro no banco
Mas eu recebi algumas contas, então eu acabei gastando a porra do estoque
Eu sou uma mexicana, vadia, então quando eu ostento na loja, eles me chamam de Maria
Eu estou pouco me fodendo para o que você me chama, só não me chame de falida
Ouço Susan apenas dar marcha à ré com seu Kia
Eu tenho um carrão e eu acabei de comprar 4 casas, até mais, quando eu te ver por aí
Muita gente não gosta que eu tenha talento e que não necessito de nada
Eu entro na porra da reunião e eles me dizem que querem meus fãs e eu digo a eles que isso não é pago
Dizem que querem que eu os ensine a fazer o mesmo que eu faço e aqui estão os detalhes:
Eu não me vendo e por isso me odeiam, sinceramente, eu mando eles irem à puta que os pariu

[Refrão]
E é assim que eu faço, e é assim que eu faço
E é assim que eu faço, e é assim que é feito
É assim que eu faço, e é assim que eu faço
E é assim que eu faço, e é assim que é feito
É assim que eu faço, é assim que eu faço
É assim que eu faço, é assim que eu faço
É assim que eu faço, é assim que eu faço
E é assim que é feito, pois é assim que é feito
[Verso 2]
Eu conheço muitas pessoas que dizem que tenho muita sorte de conseguir
Eu não me considero ninguém até os mexicanos não terem que ser empregados domésticos
Eu estou pouco me fodendo para o que a internet diz
Eu não vou fazer dessa merda parte do meu dia
Você manda mensagem para o número que eu fiz aos fãs ou não
Realmente eu estou mais do que bem, estou Gucci
Continuo G-G-G-G
No meu caminho então eu buzino, bi, bi, bi, bi
Concordando com você tipo sim, sim, sim, sim
Eu sei que realmente você me vê ser a razão
Vadias na internet (Uhh), estou pisando no pescoço de todas elas (Uhh)
Por que caralhos você está chateada? (Uhh), eu não gosto do seu macho (Uhh)
Não é minha culpa que ele está online (não), comentando que eu estou bem
Ele disse que ouviu que eu sou bi, tentando descobrir se isso é verdade
Eu já tenho tempos dizendo o mesmo
Índia Maria, nem daqui, nem de lá
Meus pais vieram diretamente do México
Arrumaram suas malas e saíram depois
Eles disseram “foda-se o Trump”
Tomando Modelo não pega Corona
Meu pai queria ter um filho corajoso
É por isso que eu saí uma filha da puta corajosa
Agora tenho negócios e preciso de dinheiro
Eu tenho um filho e ele cresce rápido
Ele me disse: “Mamãe, esses rappers são ruins”
Mas se eu deixasse que ele rimasse, ele estaria se expondo
Porque metade desses rappers está tendo uma crise de imagem toda vez que passam por isso
Todo mundo falando a real nas músicas, mas os cuzões não podem fazer isso

E é assim que eu faço, e é assim que eu faço
E é assim que eu faço, e é assim que eu faço
É assim que eu faço, e é assim que é feito
E é assim que eu faço, e é assim que eu faço
É assim que eu faço, é assim que eu faço
É assim que eu faço, é assim que eu faço
É assim que eu faço, é assim que eu faço
E é assim que é feito, pois é assim que é feito

[Verso 3]
Eu gosto de aparecer em shows, bebo tequila, sou tão real quanto eles
Mas descobri que até pessoas que ajudei têm inveja do que é meu
Então comprei uma arma para mim
E vai ser tipo Boom, boom, boom, pow
Mato à vontade e essa é a Fergie
E se eu te ajudar e você tentar atirar em mim como a Yolanda fez
Eu juro por Deus que vou ser suja com você
Porque eu sou uma lenda, mas vocês não vão ver até depois que eu me for
Mas é assim que as coisas são
Mas eu sou honesta, eu não ligo por ser uma, se é isso que é preciso, porque meu filho tem que crescer
Mas eu vou falar a porra das minhas verdades e estou representando como sempre fiz
Ainda vou derramar um pouco de gota mexicana, ainda canto Chente quando fico bêbada
Isso é novo para vocês, garotinhos
Mas eu representei essa bandeira mesmo quando as gravadoras diziam “Querida, isso não é assim”
Agora eles estão tentando fazer um outro eu, espere um pouco, espere, porra, posso pegar minha parte?
Tudo o que venho fazendo, eles estão pegando o que está acontecendo
Eles querem nossa cultura, mas não demonstram amor
Eles querem nosso dinheiro, mas aqui eles não nos querem, mano

The sky turns black again
A roar from the sky
Makes the silence feel so wonderful
My eyes are open again
I can't see more than unclear (shadows)
Shadows that seem to follow my path
Lightning burn my eyes

A slumber, a silent and deeper sleep
The smell of rain
Burned by the lightning within
Unknown is this pain

The clouds lie silent like a cage
Around what used to be
I can not reach the other side and
You can not reach me
The clouds lie silence like a cage
Around what used to be
Stuck within this cube for all time
From this place I can not flee
The whispers make me insane
I can not shut them out
No longer in control of my body
I close my eyes, dreams emerge
A new thunderclap awakens my mind
It is all like it used to be
I am trapped within my own imagination
Who has got the key to the gate?

A slumber, a silent and deeper sleep
The smell of rain
Burned by the lightning within

Around what used to be

You can not reach me

Alone I stand again...

Creation or a Stain,pop,Joseph Arthur,119.0,"I got a god in my head
Tells me that I'm crazy
Got a god in my head
Telling me I'm crazy
An angry little god punching on my skull
Another little god
Tells me that I'm lazy
A useless piece of shit with no love to give at all now
And the smallest god up there
Thinks that I'm the greatest
Tells me no one else could be as good as me
I listen to them all, I was a disc jockey to consequences
Little propagandist selling misery
I build a cocoon I got to get away
A shirt made out of wood and glue and crack and then some paint(????)
No one see ya down there and no one's getting in
I got a needle, a pack, a satchel, and a quart of country gin
I drink and shoot and smoke until the only voice I hear
Is the one telling me those other people, don't let anybody near
No don't let anybody near (x4)
And now the telephone is ringing, the walls are falling down
The city birds are singing, my soul's nowhere around
I have made myself a monster
I have damned myself again
I have eaten all my children, I have tightened up my skin
I'm a walking crucifixion, I'm a fucked-up memory
Consumed in all that's left, I'm my mother's misery
I'm sucking on Satan's tit
She's milking me her pussy
Flower
I drink until I'm convinced there's no place left to go
You know there's no place left to go (x4)
So I drink until the pain is dry
I know it never is
Sometimes though, I guess I think that I'm the best
Until the morning after when I wake up with the guilt
Of burning down all the things my sacred hands have built
And throwing out all the love you know I never felt
Yeah, you know I never felt (x4)
Let's make our tortured Romeo's
Personal help can be unique
You bring it on yourself
Burn out when you might peak
The Holy Ghost is exiled from your heart and from your soul
If you control it it's no fun, and if it's fun you've lost control
Your past is plagiarism
Your symbols have dried up
Your corruption's as confused
As old lovers that you dug
Like some hidden toxic fume
Your soul dissipates
In the ozone of guilty acts with motive
All the things you hate
There's bodies dancing, crazed
Sexual heat
Crazy in an orgy
The way starving people eat
Regrets weight overwhelms, and tired bodies fall
Bankrupt from the beaten
Let's split one more eight-ball
Blue as beggars, beaten, bleeding
Tired eyes made of rust
And we all know when it gets like this there's no one you can trust
No no there's no one you can trust(x4)
Some say the solution's locked in the sweat-box
I wouldn't know
I've never been there, I sold my keys to get a rock
We sing along to forgotten AM radio stations
And drink expensive wine, toast the friends that we left hanging
Like prisoners in conceit
We heard through the cracks
I know for sure don't trust no one who says' they've got you back
The windows all explode
Outside the noise pollution booms
Everyone's now hidden like cockroaches in dark rooms
I've been brought back from the dead before, so anything can happen
Obsessed with tragic antics, down and out like Eric Clapton
These are my wild years, I'm trying to enjoy the pain
The euphoria of dying
Toxins wrestle in my brain
We've all been leaders of corruption
We've all been spiders on the wall
Waiting for a hand to smash us or the doom of light to fall
Is this guilt of just self-hatred
Runnin' wild, uncontained
Leaking from a broken soul
Is this creation or a stain

Więcej grzechów nie pamiętam,rap,Trzeci Wymiar,1110.0,"[Verse 1: Szad]
W imię ojca i rapu spowiedź syna
Nie pamiętam, ale chyba tak to się tak zaczyna
Ojcze ja Szad
Zawsze trzymałem się zasad własnych
Cel mam jasny, nie być jak insekty w mieście umarłej nadziei
Szukać perspektyw, rapowe projekty, wprowadzać korekty i czekać na efekty
A za plecami szepty, wyszczerzone kły kundli
Moim grzechem to, że nie okradam kumpli, Ojcze
Moich ludzi, którzy przy mnie mimo że żaden z nich nie musi diabeł kusił
Ale nas nie skłóci
Moim grzechem
Że rapowa stopa dla mnie cenniejsza niż ropa
Że 24 godziny ma moja doba
To choroba
Że rozdwoić się nie umiem i że nie rozumiem ludzi bez ambicji
Błędne oczy zakłamanych niewolników fikcji
Jestem winny ojcze, bo buduje zamiast burzyć w imię hip hopowej róży
Żaden ze mnie murzyn
Przeciw mnie, bo ta intryga, bo Szad to nie nigga
Dla mnie to nie California, New York, LA czy New Jersey
Robię rap'a w takiej wersji, merci, moim grzechem, że nie wchodzę w dupę innym
Widzisz sam ojcze, że jestem winnym

Jeśli w twoich oczach to grzech odpokutuję
Jestem tu ja, moi ludzie i mój rap tu jest
Więcej grzechów nie pamiętam, za żaden nie żałuję

[Verse 2: Nullo]
Znam parę grzechów, żyją w człowieku
Ojcze wysłuchaj, bo mam parę tu
Jestem pyszny, bo bywa, że pycha wypycha mój mózg
Kiedy słyszę dobę rymy z ust, a to atut Nullizmatyka
Słuchaj grzesznika, chciwego męczennika
Który non-top do notatnika wtyka rymów giga
Pragnę więcej, dokładnie więcej pragnę
Ojcze skaż mnie, bo wyraźnie na tej taśmie
Zakaziłem w całym paśmie bity brudem
Moja nieczystość cudem, robię to z wielkim trudem
Mówisz, że jestem czubem - Null chce tu zabić nudę
Nie kończę, bo poddaję się próbie
Tu gdzie ludzie mają języki długie
Ojcze mój gniew to dla ludzi grzech
Gdy robię muzę to o spokój walczę jak lew!
Ej wy sąsiedzi przestańcie mi tu bredzić
Że za dużo decybeli na waszych głowach siedzi
Nie musicie mnie już śledzić jak banda ludożerców
Bo ja mam to w sercu!

Na moim miejscu

Confessions of a martial mind,pop,Scarcross,9.0,"I am the warrior of pain
Darkness is my lonely fate
And as I wander through land and time
I search for a view of sense in this life

Been on the search for years
For anything that fills this torturing emptiness
I searched the myths
I searched the art
Been through the tears and through the bliss

As darkness falls onto the land
And the shadows reach for my soul
As even silence leaves me alone
And the sorrow is my last companion
The pipes call me to arms
For the eternal battle
So I search for my strength
In the myths of times long bygone

Oh you past heroes give me the might
Pray to ancient gods
In the halls of Avalon
So that I can raise my sword
And fight this hated life
[Chorus]
In the castle of grief
It's where you want me to be
Lost, beyond a wall of pain
Laid in chains of loneliness

But pain creates hatred
Which gives me the bravery
To fight in this lost battle
Against existence and to die

I hear death calling my name
In the winds of tomorrow
Someday I will follow
And pass away into the myths
To the eternal halls of Avalon

You know there are claims to the legal system if a man sleeps with my wife I kill him and her and get away scot free. Crime of passion's what it's called. My passion extends to all the things I own. They are me. They represent me. So if a man steals from me I kill him. I kill his wife, his children, his mother. I might even throw in the family doctor for good measure. For he has taken from me something for which I have paid the infinite price. My soul

[Verse 1: Scum]
Looking at you just makes me want to crack your muthafuckin skull
With an axe and circle saw blade on a stick rusty and dull
Makin me want to leave you strangled with intestines I remove
Fuckin with my shit ain't worth it that's the point I'm trying to prove
No forgiveness no remorse I got no love
You can pray but there's no rescue from above
You can offer me your daughter and your wife but there's nothing you can do to save your muthafuckin life
What you thinkin what you smokin did you think I'd let her walk
When I'm finished all of you are gonna be outlined in chalk
When I'm finished there'll be blood all over the ceiling and the walls
And your baby girl's saliva gonna be dripping off my balls
Cuz it doesn't matter what you stole from me
You'd be safer fuckin a girl with HIV
With no condom when my shit is what you take
You and all the ones you love will have to pay for that mistake

This shit is mine (This shit is mine)
You messed up bad (You messed up bad)
Your fuckin fingers all up in my cookie jar
I'm gonna get broken and get a string that's gonna hear them crack (crack crack)
You've must've lost your mind and take what's mine, you went too far
Now you will die (now you will die) cuz I don't play (cuz I don't play)
When it comes to money fuck you pay me pay in full
You can bet your life but I'ma take what's mine and blood with spray
But I cock it, damn it time to give the trigger, pull

Tryna snatch a tiger's dinner while he's eating is just dumb as some rookie ass beginner trying to steal some shit from Scum
If you want to know the feelings take your muthafucking head in the garbage sink disposal turn it on and tell me man
How many fingers can you wiggle cuz your chances to succeed is that number minus seven hollow tips to make you bleed
Razor blades to cut your face off, gasoline to torch your crib
Even got a fucking meathook to suspend you by your rib
Listen up cuz there's a lesson to be learned
That's a journey from which nobody returned
What is mine is for nobody else to take
Dream of robbing me and you might not awake
Make you suffer, beg for mercy but there is no mercy left
Then ran out and got replenished with some rage all due to theft
Only question left to answer is just when enough's enough
When a righteous angry killing turns into sadistic snuff

This shit is mine (This shit is mine)
You messed up bad (You messed up bad)
Your fuckin fingers all up in my cookie jar

A Letter From Dave Saint Cecilia,misc,Foo Fighters,1858.0,"19 November 2015

Tonight, Let me begin with a preface to a letter I wrote a few weeks ago from my hotel room in Berlin while on our final tour for this album. I felt the need to write this foreword in light of the heartbreaking tragedies of Nov. 13th, as this project has now taken on an entirely different tone. As has everything, it seems...

The Saint Cecilia EP was put into motion back in October of this year as a celebration of life and music. The concept being that, as our world tour drew to a close this week, we wanted to share our love of both with you in return for everything you have given us.

Now, there is a new, hopeful intention that, even in the smallest way, perhaps these songs can bring a little light into this sometimes dark world. To remind us that music is life, and that hope and healing go hand in hand with song. That much can never be taken away.

To all who were affected by the atrocities in Paris, loved ones and friends, our hearts go out to you and your families. We will return and celebrate life and love with you once again someday with our music. As it should be done.

Dave Grohl

----------------------------------------------------------------------

8 November 2015

Hey.

Thanks.

For real.
It was in Austin, Texas March 14th, 2013, at the last show of the “Sound City Players” when I was given a small, but very relevant and perhaps prophetic gift from my Sound City movie producers Jim Rota and John Ramsay. An empty journal, with a note that said something along the lines of, “Congratulations on everything Sound City.....now get to work on the next project!” It was the most beautiful way to end something that I wanted so badly to last forever: with a new beginning.

The basic concept of the Sonic Highways album and series was born right then and there, in a small backstage room surrounded by mountains of Lone Star beer and Stubbs BBQ. 8 songs, 8 cities, 8 studios, and a musical road trip of a lifetime. Removing the Foo Fighters from our comfort zone and challenging the process from top to bottom, it breathed new life into the band, and set us on a journey that unquestionably exceeded any of our simple expectations. And now it has led us here. To another beautiful ending.

So, where do I begin?

We owe it all to Mexico City.

Unbeknownst to them, the people who attended those two concerts back in December, 2013 at Foro Sol stadium helped fund the filming and recording of the bulk of the Sonic Highways project. They were the fuse that lit this little firecracker, baby. Without those gigs, many may have never heard the incredible and truly inspiring life stories of Buddy Guy, Steve Albini, Ian Mackaye, Tony Joe White, Zac Brown, Dolly Parton, Roky Erickson, Gary Clark Jr, Bruce Pavitt, Fred Drake, Terry Lickona, Joan Jett, Steve Rosenthal, Nora Guthrie......a list too long to share here. But, beyond giving our band the equivalent of a rock and roll university year abroad, they gave the entire world the most priceless gift: Inspiration. So....Gracias a todos, Mexico....we couldn’t have done it without you.

Before long, our rag tag crew of ne’er-do-wells was stumbling from city to city, coast to coast, taking in every drop (!) of 100 proof American culture we could squeeze. Dancing in a New Orleans second line parade, laying under the desert stars in Joshua Tree, walking the streets of Chicago in -30 degree weather...it was an American dream come true. Our only responsibility was to share it with you, and the brave people of HBO trusted us with that much. (very freely, I might add.) Blind faith? Perhaps. But, without Nina Rosenstein, we would not be the people who we are today. Looking back, she gave us something immeasurably generous: some of the greatest memories of our lives. These people and places that we experienced have filled our hearts...and ultimately our songs. So, thank you, Nina. We are yours. But, focused on the moment, we never in our wildest dreams could have imagined the whirlwind 23 months that lay ahead of us. We just put one foot in front of the other, and kept moving....

I must admit, I never looked at our schedule. I was too scared. I knew that this was it. This was the big one. There was talk of stadiums, and anniversaries, and TV shows. South Africa, Korea, Colombia. Letterman and Glastonbury. It all seemed too good to be true! But, as always, we kept our heads down and tried to appreciate every single moment as it fled. Because, you realize, none of this was ever supposed to happen. Ever. As we approached our twentieth anniversary, it was hard not to look back on all of those years and smile while shaking our heads in wonder and disbelief. From the Mike Watt van tour of 1995, to RFK stadium in Washington DC (my hometown gig) July 4th, 2015...those dots don’t necessarily connect in real life, you know? It still boggles the mind. But, the spoils of these blessings are not lost upon us. We count every last one.

Even the disasters.

A lucky break? Yeah, you could call it that. Gothenburg was a swift reminder that life is short, and that we’re all here to live it together, no matter what adversity you’re faced with. (Music! The perfect remedy!) Sure, weeks and weeks of shuffling around hotel rooms on my butt with a cast on my leg, trying to pack my suitcase alone before lobby call got pretty fucking stale pretty fucking quick. But, as always, I just put one foot in front of......well, the same one for a while there...

And then everything changed. The energy. The atmosphere. THE THRONE. I was no longer afraid to look at the schedule, I was glued to it. The challenge that we faced from there on out became more of a mission, or a dare, if you will. And it showed. Pat’s smile got even wider (an infallible barometer of all things), Chris’s solos got even faster (thank God someone knows what they’re doing up there), Nate’s stage moves more daring (I once noticed him just to the left of me) and Taylor’s drum set....well....it got pinker. But not without the help of scores of hardworking bad asses that some might call the Foo Fighters road crew (we like refer to them as family, in a very Manson Family kind of way...) They ultimately deserve the lion’s share of credit for keeping this old circus tent erect for the past 6 months. So, let’s all have a nice, warm diet Coke for them tonight. They’re the hardest working motherfuckers in the business. Cheers.

And so we trudged on. Any fatigue was met with an explosion of energy once the curtain went up. Any pain was met with the adrenaline of thousands of voices singing along. Every one of you kept us alive for a while there. One night, at a point where I felt like I was at the end of my rope, it came to me that these few hours we have together every night were something like a heavy blanket to retreat under. I could always rely on our time together to get me to the next stop. Again, and again. From Chicago to Cesena.

That being said....we’ve always been pretty good at knowing when to call it a day. You just....know. You get that feeling that, if you’re not careful, you’ll run out of bread crumbs to find your way home and be lost in the woods forever. It hit me a few months back, crept up on me and tapped me on the shoulder as if to say “Hey...don’t spend it all in one place, asshole.” A sobering reminder that all good things must come to an end. Of course...we could keep going. After all, we’d made it this far, right? What’s another 20 years?

Around that time we arrived in Austin, Texas for the Austin City Limits festival. A massive gig, two weekends and hundreds of acts, it was to be some of our final American performances for this album. There’s a certain bittersweet relief to that. On one hand, you’re carrying these monumental experiences under your wing as you anticipate life outside of a tour bus. On the other hand, you fear that the thrill and joy of sharing music with people all over the world will leave you like an empty shell when it’s gone. It becomes your everything. And that’s terrifying.
The Saint Cecilia Hotel, named after the patroness saint of music, is known as “A lush retreat from the world”. And, believe me, that it is! 14 rooms and a small bar, it’s tucked away in the trees within a bustling, Austin neighborhood. As our van pulled up in the wee hours of September 30th, 2015, I was struck with a rather impulsive idea: to record some songs on our days off to give to the world as a “thank you” for the last 2 years. Though there’s a world class recording studio just on the other side of the fence (Arlyn Studios, look it up.), the hotel manager, Jenny offered that we record in the hotel. A most generous, but unrealistic offer. Though, after rolling it around in my head a few times, it made perfect sense! Returning to the city where the entire Sonic Highways concept was born, loading in one last time to a room that was never designed to be a recording studio a la Sonic Highways, and making some music! Fate? Destiny? I was too tired to figure that kind of shit out, so I hit the sack, woke up the next morning and started making some calls...

By 6 pm the next day, the office was transformed into a control room and the bar was littered with microphones and cables. Amps were in the kitchen. Drums in front of the fireplace. Instant studio, courtesy of the legendary Kevin Szymanski! (Those fancy computer things are pretty convenient! More on that another time....) Margaritas were made, friends came to visit, the sun went down, and before long we started making enough noise to drive the neighbors to start drinking along with us. Riffs and ideas were thrown around, songs that were lost in the shuffle over the years, songs that were left unfinished. Like a musical retrospective, we were going through decades of songs no one has ever heard, pieces left on the cutting room floor from every album. Our own sonic scrapbook. (The Neverending Sigh is 20 years old! Was once called 7 corners for all you die hards out there...) Without the usual pressure or expectation of making an “album”, we sat happy and relaxed as we played. A virtual “This Is Your Life” of the Foo Fighters. It was so good, but again, bittersweet knowing that it was all soon coming to an end.

By midnight, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band had arrived, and the “session” turned into a full on party. Guitars were abandoned for horns and the room started swinging (spinning?). People danced between the cables and microphones, dancing behind the bar, strumming acoustic guitars on the patio. Danny Clinch did what Danny Clinch does, capturing the moments in his beautiful pictures between cocktails. Gary Clark Jr. sat on the patio in the candlelight, jamming along with friends from a couch. As the hours passed, the atmosphere had reached exactly what every recording experience should be: A celebration. “Always record! Always record!” said Jack Black in that infamous Tenacious D episode from years ago. Truer words have never been spoken. Because you just might miss something that you’ll never get back again. Moments that happen once in a lifetime. By the time that weekend was over, we had recorded 5 songs in that tiny room.

Weekend two was spent recording vocals and guitars in my bedroom, room 4. More friends, more margaritas, a fire in the fire pit. The most fabulous Cambria Harkey floated in, slinging her camera to insure that this wasn’t all just a dream. The porch was buzzing with activity as I did vocals in my bathroom, stepping in and out to listen to the previous takes. The coffee table became a pile of guitar pedals and scribbled lyrics, beer bottles and ashtrays. At one point, a familiar face walked in and said, “Dave.....it’s Ben Kweller.....” It had been years! Such a talented young man. We hugged, hit play to listen to the last vocal take, and he instinctively started singing the perfect harmony to my line. Without hesitation, I immediately said, “Get your ass in there and sing it right now.” So he picked up the coffee stained piece of hotel stationary with my lyrics penciled on it and banged out his part in two glorious takes. Always record, ladies and gentlemen. Always record. The night faded, friends and family scattered, and I fell asleep with my still glowing amp at the foot of my bed.

It was heartbreaking to leave that place, to say the least. I honestly feel like we left a piece of our band there as we were being torn away from it. The perfect unity of life, and love, and music is something that only comes around so often and in certain circumstances. When you feel it coming on, you have to take hold of it. That place and those people made it possible for our band to take one, big final breath before the curtain closes. Thankfully, we have evidence of this in these songs that we’re giving to you today. Thank you, Saint Cecilia. You made us feel right at home.

And, the music? Maybe these songs are the breadcrumbs that will help us find our way back when it’s time. We could use a nice wander through the woods right about now. Another empty journal, another tap on the shoulder...those things are never far behind. It’s what lies ahead in those woods that excites me now....

So tonight, as I sit in my Berlin hotel room on our final tour for this album, counting down the days until we return home, I can’t help but wonder when we will see each other again. Who knows? But, with everything Foo Fighter related, it will only be when it feels right. And that’s a feeling that’s easy to feel.

To each and every one of you that made the past few years the best our band has ever had, thank you. You have all given us so much, and we are eternally grateful.

For real.

One foot in front of the other....

Pale,rock,Dessiderium,76.0,"There goes the heron that sits at the shore
Awaiting to feed on a helpless bird
Ten foreign trees towered up above me
This scene before my eyes was one I’ve not seen

Suddenly I felt a stare from behind
In naivety and innocence
I turned back my head
Clothed in white, she stood there
With one subtle look
I was put on the path to my end

Transparent woman
In brush strokеs so pale
Moonlight came forth
Through creasеs of her hair
That fell to her knees
In angelic grace
She now came toward me

With each step she took
My dead heart was struck
I know this face
Her lips moved
Yet her voice was mute
Still I knew
Aria was her name
This world, her womb
“I know your heartache
I’ll mend your pain
Absolve your sins
Free your shame
I’ve waited here
Forever for your love
To come set me free
I’ve grown as you’ve grown
I’ve been with you in sleep
Since it all began”

The water rose in liquid pillars up to the sky
Beware, instinct told me life’s a place to leave alone
But, you shocked me out of my being
I came from the heartless place
Now here’s your face
I’m safe
Red love swelling deep in my chest

Shame lives in me
Shame went to deep
Shame haunts my sleep
Shame will not let me breathe

You found me where it rains
Our pigment came undone
If this is what you are
You and I
Meet eyes and we merge
This sanguine songs masks desperation
Another day gone
Still nothing has come
Wandering through the memories
From our dreamscape
I write to know that it’s real

Page after page
All is blank
Journal for love became
Loose notes of hate
Fate is fake
Beliefs are traced
Believe me, please
My thoughts loop back in a voice that’s yours

And now I’m lost here with you
Lost, fading youth
Lost without truth
Lost here with you

Falling deep in a world no one else can reach
Drifting off in sleep that will grant me peace
Birth a thought and the thought comes forth and breathes
I’m in love with a dream and it feels too real
There lies the heron dead at the shore
The ocean swallows
The ocean dissolves
Sky folds it’s self
As my vision is blurred
We say goodbye

바라보지만 나의 태도는 직선
난 널 원해
네 주변에서 날 뭐라고 부르건 I don't care
너무 빠르게 해온 사랑이
아픔이라면 here's my plan
네 오른손 내게 맡기고
내 왼손이 허리를 감을 때 날 멈추고
확신이 서지 않는다면 go, leave
아니면 흐르는 곡에 몸을 실어 응답해줘

No Retreat Kutmasta Kurt Remix,rap,Dilated Peoples,91.0,"""The mind-blowing party-rocking Platform crew"" (scratched 4x)
""That's Rakka-Iriscience, Evidence, Babu""

[Iriscience]
It's no retreat, hit the street, get my plane confirmation
To the other side of the world, a daily operation
First stop in Vegas, can't keep these lions locked in cages
We rock in places where alcohol's for all ages
On stages, in great heights land in London at night
LAX today, MP tight
A 2000 Technique cha, cut and freak
Detonate our drums, heat the plastique

[Evidence]
Ayo funky, straight up with the force to keep fighting
Samson, Atlas, Collossus, Titan
In the dark night the torch that enlightens
Our strong cast-iron, harder the lion
A mighty foundation, many mouths to feed
With the energy needed to turn a seed to weed
We're fortified tight, sturdy sound construction
Make rappers ""Duck Down"" like I'm Boogie Down Productions
[Iriscience]
Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat

""To the enemy"" ""No surrender no retreat"" (Repeat 2x)

[Evidence]
Yo we serve a full spectrum of flavors that's robust
Hustle in the same industry I don't trust
I know California dig it like a gold rush
And worldwide no retreat, we cold crush
Beef up support, insulate your stage or pay
Make way for the prophets of rage
While they engage to let you know we're in a new age
Babu will make a DJ turn a new page

[Iriscience]
Cause that's a dangerous man that can speak with his hands
Watered-down lyrics on dirty tracks turned to sand
To sink in, better watch the X that you ink in
Or on, disrespect us, step on my lawn
Skip the death threats, MC or graph and test these wrong
Your letters are wack, they get blown like mailbombs
I'm on the next train to your thought that's caught
Where I'm going, no retreat, hit the beat, exit the plot
[Evidence]
Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat

""To the enemy"" ""No surrender no retreat"" (Repeat 2x)

[Iriscience]
Uh, no retreat, get right up back out
Cuff the mic that's wack, develop tools to tap out
No doubt, Dilated's turning pros to flows
(No retreat) I risk my life on flights for hype shows

[Evidence]
And now you rocking with the camp that rocked last at Tramps
Worldwide, collecting little passport stamps
From the body to the mind like I'm Jesse Ventura
This millenium and mark 2000 like Futura

[Iriscience]
Bet, rest assured vaccines ain't far from cures
PLant some new shit, hit me two weeks into tour
But I'll adapt, guaranteed make it through
Eveidence, Iriscience, and my man Babu

[Evidence]
We freak by the KNK crazily
Pro game, expansion team, major league
Rakka-Iriscience trained to go the length
I'm an all-terrain think tank at full strength
[Iriscience]
Yo, stand my ground, dig in with both feet
No surrender, no turning no cheek, no retreat

[Part 1 - Heiermann]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Da sind so viele die dich testen wollen
Du musst nur behutsam vorgehen und der Rest wird folgen
Lass dich nicht unterkriegen hab Geduld
Willst du ne Nummer schieben 'nimm die null die lässt sich rollen
Und wer weiß schon wohins mich führt
Also nehme ich von vornherein die Hintertür
Die ganzen Leute sagen ich bin konfus
Doch sie kennen mich doch gar nicht
Ich bin verwirrt
Ich bin der Wirt hier ist die Rechnung für dich
Mädels begleichen mit nem Lächeln und der Rest ist für mich
Und ich schätze das ist das beste Logo ich will nicht ohne gehen
Ist für mich letztlich die Rettungsweste auf hoher See
Ja ich texte um zu sehen wer ich bin
Hab ein Segel häng die Seele in den Wind
All die Worte sind wie Pforten ja sie geben mir ein Wink
Ja sie geben mir ein' Hinweis also nehm ich es so hin

Heute bringt mich der Scheiß um mein' Verstand

Das nich in Ordnung wie bei Hempels unterm Sofa
Ok ich bin kein Mozart doch machs klassisch - Und
Lass erst los wenn der Bogen überspannt ist
Glätt die Wogen wenn ich Welle mach
Acte verzogen wie Noel Gallagher
Weiß dass der Bobel es nicht besser macht
Doch was solls so völlig ohne ist doch auch wack
Ich bin nur froh dass ich nicht in Christian Zieges Haut steck [Haste auch Recht]
Ich bau Tracks und Headbang mir Hämathome
Flenn mich aus bis ich wegrenn' und Zewas hole
Ist alles nicht so grottig wie's klingt
Ich bleib einfach nur n trotziges Kind [Fuck]

Shoot a demon in his head

Want a dark nigga dark
That's the masked me
I don't procrastinate
Baby what the task be
Crazy flow and bake made me happy
Wanna love a bitch but she too trashy
Don't let my words eat you up
Live lavish
Wicked got the riches
Came from ragged fits

And lobster for dinner, and we can do that
And still be truthful with how you use rap
And not become a John Cusack like a lot of new cats
Be you and never lose that, my n*gga that can be perfect
Darker purp and harder work, watch how this legend emerges
From from the surface of where you came from
The yongest of Ruthie Jane's sons
If you can find another rapper hotter than n*gga name one
Oh you can't? well explain them comparisons
I'll embarrass son, if he average and ain't jumping like Woody Harrelson
Please.. it's guaranteed ima be blessing these beats
Especially since every rapper seem desperate to be
The next MC to go and claim the fame, prolly even change his name
Meanwhile im on a plane getting blown like a Sega game
Or ol' boy from Taylor Gang, only aim to change to game
Critics asking ""whats the difference"" tell em' we don't think the same
In the strange but dopest gears, spittin like the golden years
Flow getting colder, and yo shit ain't nowhere close to his
So.. im roasting grenidiers, toke it slow til smoke appears
Funny how my coffee table mostyl filled with open beers
Guess it help me cope with fears or failure or whatever
But when these two get mixed together, I tend to give a ""f"" lesser
Than I, did before, feeling like it's for sure, cus lord knows
I got dreams of being seen at award shows, as far as the art goes
I jus let my heart flow, teach ya while I beat ya
Like Sophia did Harpo, reference to ""The Color Purple""

Once upon a boat!

Once upon a boat
Jesus went to sleep
But soon a storm had filled the sky
And waves began to leap

Once upon a boat
Though Jesus was on board
His friends became so terrified
As stormy waters roared

[Chorus]
Once upon a boat

We can trust
He'll be with us
Wherever the wind will blow
Once upon a boat
A miracle at sea
For He’s the Lord of sea and sky
And Lord of you and me

Once upon a boat
Jesus woke surprised
To see the looks of frightened friends
And hеar their panicked cry

Once upon a boat
Hе did not wait to late
""Do not be afraid"", He said
You all need some more faith

[Chorus]
Once upon a boat
Jesus took control
We can trust
He'll be with us
Wherever the wind will blow
Once upon a boat
A miracle at sea
For He's the Lord of sea and sky

Once upon a boat
He stood to face the waves
With just a word He calmed the storm
And turned off all the rain
Once upon a boat
His friends were all relieved
And so amazed at Jesus’ power
It helped them to believe

[Chorus, Spoken]
Once upon a boat
Jesus took control
We can trust
He'll be with us
Wherever the wind will blow

Web wielding wizard
Or you can call me triple threat
Let's have a skyscraper battle
That's when Spidey's at his best
Web ya up with wordplay
'Cuz the wicked never get to rest
Flipping through the verses
Put this dimwit to the test
Throwing off your symbiote
Grab a Venom by the throat
One v One, that's all she wrote
You're never getting Spidey's goat
So listen close, you adrenaline sucking Dracula
No matter what you do
You'll nevеr beat the spectacular

[Verse 2: Venom]
An adrеnaline super villain-
You could never test us
Well grab a frail little spider
Crush his bones into dust
From our super durability
To our genetic memory
We never drop a grudge
Until we slaughter all our enemies
We're glad you threw us off
Our new host is the perfect size
Spidey's falling fast
While the Super Venom's on the rise
We're shape shifting whenever we roll through
When you're laying in your blood
Don't say that we hadn't told you
[Verse 3: Spiderman]
As Brock or as Venom, you simply fall flat
I'll shatter your whole world
Wait-
I already did that
I'm a better reporter
Than you would ever be
I'll put this bum to sleep
With a deadly spider melody
Your own race of aliens
All said that you were too weak
I asked around the Bugle, they all say that
Spidey's too fleek
Back on the big screen
And this Venom's still slumming
The King steeped away
But this is my Homecoming

[Verse 4: Venom]
You're coming home to death
And to total obliteration
We'll separate your head from your neck
With no hesitation
Our villainous and venomous ways
Will never stop
We'll lay your ass to rest
Like your Uncle, mom, and Pop
We nullify the spider sense
He'll never know what hit him
Venom hit tot he skull
He won't even recall what bit him
Puny Parker, stand still
And we'll make your death hasty
But it's going to sting worse
Than when you killed Gwen Stacy

Alright
The low blows are flying
I'm swinging above that
This Venom is dying

Freaky hoe in my house, она меня душит
Но мне как-то похуй, ведь я просто простодушен
Залетаю на трэп хаус, мои homies творят магию
Мы сварили стафф, нам не нужен кубик магии
Мой братан полег, наверное дело в плохом питании
Я закинул ему perc, он как новенький из Дании

Я пизданул хуйню и мне похуй, что там дальше
Я снова на бите, но я не тот уже кто раньше
Сука не шалава, но ведь сука хочет панчей
Собрал много куша, да я закурил их насмерть
Ха, в моем кармане куша больше чем на Амазонке
Я пролил свой лин, блять моя футболка

Wiesz za co! Wiesz za co!]

Synu, nie- nie jestem Zbawcą
Za to dobrym radcą
Tak niezawodnym, zdolnym, by darzyć łaską
Miej się na baczność miasto chce Twojej zguby
Ja ostatni bastion dam gładko pokonać trudy
Matka…
Wiesz co się z Twoją mamą stało
Mało brakowało z Tobą też by się stało to samo
To nie jest proste jesteśmy za mali, by zmieniać misterne plany tego, co boskie
Masz być mi synem, dać się okiełznać
Nagroda tak jak kara płynie prosto z serca
Znaj drogę miłosierdzia
M jak Maryja
Religia nie mami, dzięki niej mija trud człowieczeństwa
Na górze jest KUP co rusz daje nam szansę
Klucz do nieba wrót, to cud wiary w hierarchię
Każdy raz ode mnie to prolog zmian na lepsze
Gdy wokół każdy sępem- wychowam silną bestię
Wiedz, że kara jest nagrodą- dziękuj za nią
Jakoś muszę Cię wychować, płacisz słono, ale w zamian za to
Dostajesz światło, silny charakter
Tak wielu upadło, Ty możesz wytknąć palcem
Chcę, żebyś kochał, szanował życie
Nie chcę Cię pochować i chować twarzy ze wstydem
Idź dumnie przez ulice, nie czuj się gorzej
Nawet jeśli wytkną Cię, że chował Cię samotny ojciec
Miałem sen o tym jak pojąłeś sens
Oczy miałeś wbite w ziemię gdzieś, na znak pokory
Po prostu słuchaj mnie i wiedz, że prawda zwycięża
Wszystko czego chcę, od swojego dziecka- bądź jak... ojciec
Nie jestem winny, nie jesteś winny
Błędne dzieciństwo to nie jest już dziecinny błąd
Tworzenie więzi szło jak krew z nosa
Mierny dryg rodzicielski, krew w oczach
Nie jestem winny, nie jesteś winny
Błędne dzieciństwo to nie jest już dziecinny błąd
Tworzenie więzi szło jak krew z nosa
Pręgi- dni udręki, krew z nosa

{Kiedyś mu oddam. Oddam mu tak, żeby wiedział, jak boli. Żeby wiedział, że nie musi się tak męczyć, że wystarczy raz żebym poczuł.}

Tata…
Tato!
Wiem czego chciałeś - byś dobrym ojcem, lecz
Możliwości jest morze, popłynąłeś z prądem
Robiłem, co mogłem, nie jestem ze stali! Ta…
Jesteśmy za mali, społeczny ład Cię przewalił
Możesz sobie wsadzić tą mądrość
Hartowanie? (Co?)
To było owijanie twarzy folią!
Wywalanie z chaty, jak psa w mróz, jak stare szmaty
Nie wiem czy to alko Ci wyżarło mózg?!
Rany przez pasy- Twoje trasy do piekła- ból
Chciałem do mamy, gdyby żyła, byłaby wściekła w chuj
Wyjeżdżasz mi z radami znów, przestań się pruć
Tata…- stratatata!- stek bzdur!
Miliard w rozumie, sto rad na minutę
Zobacz, jaki jest świat- mogę tym wytrzeć dupę
Dałbyś mi szmal lub pomysł na biznes
To się bardziej przyda, niż powołania na biblię
Wokół polowania ludzi nie dają mi spać
Ja chcę być jak oni, oni nie chcą być jak ja
Mam do Ciebie żal, mówiłeś: ,,Da się żyć bez kłamstw”
Mówiłeś: ,,Mogę wszystko”- a to tylko bal nierównych szans
To paplanina- bez jaj
Jak mam się nie spinać, jak co chwila owijają prawdę w kolejną warstwę szmat
Kulawy tandem, padnie któryś z nas
Ze mnie wyszedł cham? Ta… taki od taty dar
Nie jestem winny, nie jesteś winny (choć)
Błędne dzieciństwo to nie jest już dziecinny (błąd)
Starałeś się, nie znałeś innej drogi na mój start
Dziadka sposoby? Mówił, że pomaga lanie w twarz
Zrobiłeś co mogłeś, ale nie pomogłeś
Wybacz, to nie mądre, ale wolę śmierć od Twojego życia
Nie będę Tobą!

Nie jestem winny, nie jesteś winny

Delma Extra, tastes the whole family
(A cycled tick-tick cycle)
Real bread with country butter
Do you remember this taste?
Who is playing the tag? (lux, zium)

[Verse 1]
Listen to what I will tell you
I used to have little space, now 10 giga free (a lot, lux)
I drink the original cola, I count the files
4 giga on Chomikuj I have bought (four, yeah, show, show)
I have a watch on my hands, you will not believe it but its parts are edible (show)
Silent!
I'm doing tricks on my bike
I have a gear in the steering wheel and beads on the spokes (sh sh sh)
When I get up in the morning, I cook myself a soup
You buy gum balls, and I chew Huba Buba (oh)
On my T-shirt Cropp, I'm an old woman and not a peasant (no, no)
I am a peasant and old woman, she just got rhymed (kruci)
Your beloved mother is always trying for you
So wash after dinner, she will be happy (yes)
I really like dragees and those black and white ones
So I bought two packages, I did not even think about it (I can afford it)
The only one, tasty as raspberry cream
Four to the left, six to the right
Two up, eight down
[Bridge]
I still have shoes like that, what I do is shine when I walk
And the scooter, which when I go it shines its wheels
And what now?

[Verse 2]
What hurts you? (what?)
Does it hurt you so much
That I go out of the shop with a pack of Zozole in school?
You catch me on a break, ask if I will give you one
I look at you like that, ""No problem, buddy""
I have a modern cellphone, there are three cameras in it
The phone is for ringing, I do not know the number for my dad
There are MP3s and colorful wallpapers
I have all games, Pokemons, and the screen is sprawling

[Bridge]
So what, a lot of people like that

[Verse 3]
Silver on my teeth, because that's what the dentist told me
You do not close your mouth, mine is not clean at all
I'm sorry if I'm unkind, I did not mean anyone
My computer is still going on, I do not pay for the electricity anyway
Even then, I'm not afraid, like near lightning
Often you can hear that there are those who storm their equipment burned
But what is the problem, how is it going ...
[Bridge]
Then what?
A little problem because it's not everyone can buy it right away
But I can, in this hip-hop I can

[Outro: Klocuch & Szczupix]
Huba buba
I am an angel and I am a sign of good
Huba buba
I am the devil and I represent hell
Huba buba
Well, what will you tell me now, buddy?
Huba buba
Huba buba
Relax, do not cry
Huba buba
Huba buba
Huba buba

Shit, I go eat it then clean up the dishes
Won't get respect 'til my soul getting lifted
""Oh here he go 'bout to go on for hours about how he struggled and how he was impoverished, he 'bout to talk about how he can make it, but nobody looking, or wanna acknowledge it""
Really tell the truth I just been focused on a comma, I can tell I'm getting better every minute, every hour, I've been living in my head 'cause I'm smoking on the sour, I been tryna make the new wave all about the knowledge

Add it, stack it then put it up

Add it, stack it then put it up

Do you wish your life would go another way?
When I grew up I thought I'd be a 99-piece symphony
But I'm whistling in the wilderness alone

I close my eyes and dare to hope
That I'm gonna bloom
Know that we'll do it, too
I'm gonna bloom
There's nothing that I can't do
It's never too late
Never too late to bloom

When winter came we slept the season through
In barren lands all given to the gloom
With healthy hearts we persevered and made it through another year
Adapting to the promises we broke

We close our eyes and dare to hope
That we're gonna bloom

You Better Hope You Die Before Me,pop,Hallelujah The Hills,36.0,"The phone line is broken
The tapes are all erased
Someone's at the door
You know his wares have all been laced
You better hope you die before me

You're out of your tree
The horses are all ready
And they know as well as me
That you better hope you die before me

Everybody knows you climb a ladder so well
Impressive demonstrations of your speech and your spell
But you better hope you die before me

So dress me up in wires
I'll plug into the feed
Of blasted out basement shows
Bursting at the seams
You better hope you die before me
The house is infested with
With pests of every kind
But at least they have the courtesy
To stay out of my mind
You're broken, alone, down, and undreamed

Or light a torch for me
Or magnify your tiny soul
With a microscope from me
You better hope you die before me",0.1433839958626777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noćima me čeka
Ne spava, luji kô rijeka
Suze teku niz obraze na grudi bez lijeka
Tuga je kurva koja čeka
Mekanu dušu da obavije kô sjenka
A nekad bila je sretna i nasmijana
S dimom nikotina, alkoholom u žilama
Psuje mi ime, kune me pijana
Svjesna da nijedna nije vrijedna njenog imena
I anđeli pali su na ljepotu
A kamoli dječak bez igdje ičega, izgubljen
I trebô mi je moment da te zavolim
Sad mi treba vječnost ljubav da u meni izumre

Dans mon quartier, les frères ont le même emploi
Seul le crime paie et la nuit, ils se déploient
Mais qu’est-ce que tu croyais ? Qu’on allait rester là à s'laisser noyer ?
Voyons, ici chacun avance selon ses moyens
Une grosse capuche recouvre ma tête grillée
Pour 2 ou 3 billets, le chrome je fais briller
Danger, le Lunatic vise, tire les dé-kiss
T'as pas besoin d'dessin, pas besoin d'une putain d'esquisse
Frappe, j'les mets à poil comme en garde à vue, enlève tes lacets
Tes chaussures, ton jean, ton pull, ton bracelet
Le biz fait tomber les liasses quelle que soit la saison
Souvent la prison au bout du tunnel, mais le réseau
S'élargit de jour en jour de nouveaux venus
A.L.I, B.2.O.B.A, j't'aurai prévenu
[Pont : Booba & Ali]
Le crime paie
Le crime paie

[Refrain : Ali & Booba]
Seul le crime paie, aucun remord pour mes pêchés
Tu m'connais, j'suis assez bestial pour de la monnaie et
N'aimant que manier l'acier pour des billets
Ici t'entends des *click click*, seul le crime paie
Seul le crime paie, aucun remord pour mes pêchés
Tu m'connais, j'suis assez bestial pour de la monnaie et
N'aimant que manier l'acier pour des billets
Ici t'entends des *click click*, seul le crime paie

[Couplet 2 : Ali & Booba]
Seul le crime paie, si t'as pas de vice repose en paix
Je suis hors-la-loi, devant elle j'veux pas ramper
Je m'introduis la nuit, quand les gens sont endormis
Le code de la rue est rude, pas besoin de permis
M'parle plus d'école, je sais qu'les re-frés déconnent
Préfèrent fumer d'l'herbe et emmerder la B.R.B
Braquer un petit con avec un 3.5.7 Python
Puisqu'on est jeunes, profitons
Puis ton gun devient une boule, un vice roulant
Eh yo yo yo dis moi fils, paraît qu'tu roules en Merco
Les narcotiques payent gros en cash flow
B.2.O.B haschisch, un phat flow
J'ai déterré la hache, enterré la colombe
Regarde le biz de hasch, de Boulogne jusqu'à Colombes
Je suis trop pourri, quand je rentre ça sent le moisi
On reconnaît mon haleine de Fleury jusqu'à Noisy
J'ai choisi mon chemin, non je crois qu'c'est mon destin
Et si tu as un 'blème, je te plante dans l'intestin
C'est le festin des deux Lunatic, tu veux en teste un
Si tu en tues un, protège ton dos ! Il en reste un
[Refrain : Ali & Booba]
Seul le crime paie, aucun remord pour mes pêchés
Tu m'connais, j'suis assez bestial pour de la monnaie et
N'aimant que manier l'acier pour des billets
Ici t'entends des *click click*, seul le crime paie
Seul le crime paie, aucun remord pour mes pêchés
Tu m'connais, j'suis assez bestial pour de la monnaie et
N'aimant que manier l'acier pour des billets
Ici t'entends des *click click*, seul le crime paie

[Couplet 3 : Ali & Booba]
Seul le crime paie, si t'es pas d'chez nous, t'as rien appris
Les vrais re-frés savent bien comment l'argent se fait
Décidés à miser tout dans le biz et
Passer au-dessus des lois et ça sans visa
Vise la dégaine de ceux qui ont traîné leurs semelles plus d'une fois sur le bitume
Tout comme le veut la coutume de ceux qui n'ont rien

[Transition : Booba & Ali]
Wesh wesh yo
Wesh yo

[Couplet 4 : Booba & Ali]
Tu sais, le crime paie protège tes seufs chef tes fesses
Et les méfaits n'cessent, regarde c'qu'on aiff
Un leur-dea sort une savonnette et les ients-ients bavent
Honnêtement les négros savent comment faire d'l'argent bêtement
Easy, du cash à la Sugar Hill AZ
Mon rap, un poème sans poésie
Et puis quoi, ça fait quoi, dis-moi toi qui sais tout
Si tu kiffes pas renoi t'écoutes pas et puis c'est tout
Seul le crime paie dans les villes du neuf ze-dou
Face à face, que des regards froids, y'a pas d'z'yeux doux
Protège ton dos, les couteaux sont aiguisés
Les frères déguisés pour des thunes peuvent te briser
Comment mépriser l'argent quand tu n'en as pas ?
Le crime est un piège, mon Dieu, j'ai mordu l'appât
Seul le crime paie…

J’ai les cojones, je me distinctes
J’suis tellement vénère que j’ai l’air calme
J’ai nagé des vagues noires me bloque, m’empêche d’émerger
J’suis en fire comme le Napalm
L’écart profond comme la fosse des Mariannes
Sur la terre ferme j’fou le bordel, mon flow est parfait j’les baises  (mon flow est parfait j'les baises)

Eux еt moi, c’est pas la même
J’suis fais de matièrе noire venue d’ailleurs, j’ai le pawa
Ils aboient mais ne mordent pas
Quand ils parlent j’les entends même pas
Leur sang bat aucun de mes semblables
Leurs sons c’est du bruit c’est du brouah
Leur rap c’est le désespoir
J’veux la fame pour broyer du noir dans mon manoir

Et j’contre des suitons avec des Katons au Napalm
J’vois la concu j’fais un facepalm
Ma démarche est macabre
Dans la pool party j’vois qu’des gauloises des babtous qui s’pavane
Bordel ils sont ou tout mes og ?
J’vois qu’des grosses putes, dans la party
Si J’rentre j'en ressors pas, elles me regardent je les fascine
Vrai gashma toujours doué au combat
Nos murs ont les builds, on les frappes pas
Au pied que des Dolce Gabbana, les sandales j’connais pas
Eux et moi, c’est pas la même, moi j’me mélange pas",0.4334459537640214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Clean Battle - Freestyle  3 ,rap,[ Tali & Milo ],134.0,"[Verse 1: tbh laci]
Alright, listen, I'm sick of this double vision
More complicated than division
Yeah, you, Josiah, you're built like a flat tire
With your musty, crusty desires, go burn somewhere in a fire
Your armadillo ankles, your dusty hair that is tangled
No, you ain't no Rapunzel
Go get lost somewhere, maybe in a jungle
You callin' me ugly? Bruh, you're so fugly
You don't look too cuddly, and not very snuggly
You're built like a breadstick, Olive Garden gets tired of it
I'm done with this bit, hope you're offended by this (Mwah)

[Verse 2: ilomilo]
Ayy, I've been waiting for this part
Hey, baby, you smell like a fart
All of a suddеn, perfumes? You add to cart!
Dusty and dastardly, you have no hеart
Your little disses with ass rhymes, you think you're smart
You're not getting any love from moi
You're caught up on stuff that's against the law
You cut your T-shirts with a saw
Cutesy crop tops? More like Suzie's flip flops
You expect lots of love on this ""hip-hop""
But the hate, it don't stop, no, won't stop
Seriously, I'll call the cops, while we're on top (Ilomilo!)
[Verse 3: Kh-ri]
I'mma be bluntly true, these clean rules are somethin' new to me
Neutering vocabulary back for what the youth can see
Usually irrelevant but relatively nice with it
Dirty mutt, barkin' for the darkest and the light skinned
Windows untinted, got nothin to hide
But we all got stuff to hide, but not this whip that I ride
It's a Honda. Sweet scent, got them uber vibes
Got them BC Super Sayings, Feel like Budokai
Got it in a clean cinch
Bummy hoodie dash, don't flash so I don't seem rich
Withdrawal from the cash, man my wallet got a mean itch
Need some cran-grape, peach mango and queen b-uhh....
Benadryl, the pocket stay itchin' still
Staring out with envy from the window sill
Y'all lil pickles know the deal with my behavior
Got the chip on my shoulder, plantin' seeds with extra flavor

[Verse 4: WokeJB]
They said no cursing? frick
Pull up on em i got a stick
Ion even fight ima have to find his kin
Yeah my girl, she a ten
I beat my cases they said I liked men (ayo, what?)
Yeah my choppa eat em up for dinner
Once we get the body ima eat his live-

Ok so I’m not used to rapping clean
This is gonna be worse than eating snap peas
I’m allergic to dairy so I cannot eat cheese
Matter of fact, I also can’t eat ice cream
I’m gonna be perfectly honest, my verse is pretty trash
But it’s better than Milo’s, and that’s a fact
By the end of the day, my money gets stacked
I just counted it up and it’s like half of half of half of a rack",0.3248973634714882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Who's that chipped out?
Twenty-one year old, hot commodity
Coming out of a bum deal lottery
With a flow like sodomy
Put it on your bitch ass quite properly
I suggest you keep all eyes on me
And don't sleep as it is I'm highly critique
Pussy, money, murder it's part of my mystique
You feelin' me, this here is one of Queens elite
Predecessor of the street
While you munch, I eat
Ja's here
The nigga you love, but still fear
I done been there, done that
Now nigga, it's my year
I can leave you on the clear view
If you ain't yet clear
Matter of fact if you breathin' be glad you got air
Shut the fuck up
When grown folks are talkin', you hear?
Or get your shit blown, baby
From mouth to ear
Don't fear, when you smoke weed and fuckin your wife
Why? 'Cause I'm a nigga for life

Spare yourself the reality of an ass whippin'
That I'm givin' when I be gettin' tight and start flippin'
On your bitch ass niggas who like forming a cipher
It gets me hyper
Want the real? I'm a slice ya!
Light ya ass up with sixteen or more
Slugs coming from my snub nose Bulldog
Raw, to the core, let's lay down some laws
This is Ja's house, bow down or bring the war
Motherfuckers
Y'all don't want to touch what's hot
Whatever it be
The mic, the Glock, the drug spot
Like a bitch, you scared of life and takin' chances
And right now, you showin' more ass then an exotic dancer
The answer is this, niggas don't wanna touch
Ja live, stronger then a fucking coke rush
See on the streets we be killin' niggas like cash
You heard? I.N.C., nigga, it's Murdaaa!

Nigga, I live amongst the thoroughbreds, was raised to blaze lead
If you get shot, play dead, and put two in his head
Known to pasteurize and criticize a nigga size
Look him right in his the eyes and leave him dead where he lies
Come through mobbin' like Crips from Compton
We're all in burners and all sippin' on Gin, fuck flossin'
Nigga, I'm tossin' iron
And if you ain't buyin'
Then you're dyin'
For denyin'
I'm so inspirin'
To the youth, see I'm settin' it straight
Lettin' them know never to step on nothin' less than an eighth
And the longer it takes, somebody is gonna die for it
The ""Streets is Watchin',"" Jigga warned you, don't ignore it
Cause only niggas holdin', go JAP and blow yen
With the six double-oh
Fresh out of the pen
Brandishing the steel for the ice
Holdin' my dick, talkin' shit, shootin' dice
A nigga for life
So whatchu sayin' is
What the fuck is a nigga?
Rob a bitch, slap a bitch
All that shit

Again,pop,Jang Jane (),35.0,"Hangul

잠들던 하루가 깨어나기 전에
익숙한 어둠에 빛이 뿌옇게 내려
새벽이 가득한 이 시간 다가오는
기억이 낯설어

그날 하늘 반쯤 감긴 달빛처럼
희미한 한줄기 불빛 등지고 앉아
긴 한숨 눈물만 숨죽여 들썩이던
아픔이 떠오르네

그래도 괜찮아
흔들리지 않아
지나간 어제의 새벽에 온데도
또 다시 그 길을 걸어간다 해도

짙은 외로움에
이 아픈 상처에
가려져 더 이상 보이지 않아도
걷고 있어 Again
차가운 빛 줄기 스쳐 지나갈 때
춤추듯 흩날리는 마른 꽃잎 하나
그을려 버린 가슴 위로 내려 앉아
뜨겁게 뛰고 있어

꺼진 촛불 남아있는 저 숨결은
얼룩진 어둠을 조금씩 비춰가고
닫혀있던 마음 작은 문 틈 사이로
또다시 스며드네

그래도 괜찮아
흔들리지 않아
지나간 어제의 새벽에 온데도
또다시 그 길을 걸어간다 해도

그대로 있어줘 내 곁에 있어줘
흐려진 달빛이 또 나를 비춰도
걸어갈래 Again

Where is the amount?
Which is a drowned?
How are you going to spend this pound?
About a money:

You wanna be led by a dollar

Honor is lost, where is a boss?
Which is this dresses u liking the most?

He will buy you
And fucking the hell is starting
But you have this stupid money
Yeah?

Holding my breath
Speaking with deat
Leave me alone
Leave it on itsеlf

Специально сжигаю мосты
Не буду не с кем мелочиться
Все говорили со мною на ты
Но это должно ведь когда то случится

Что я потеряю, все что имел
Без сожаления оставлю как есть
Я удержал тех, кого только успел
Я вспомнил, что все же могу надоесть

Fuck the fuckers,  fuck the bitchеs, fuck the snitches, fuck you all
Always hiding from the people cause in heart i have a hole
Keep it, drop it, fuck it, let me rot
I'm just a fucking walking shell who already knows the plot

Ты же представляешь, сколько проблем
Приносит this life – о том я и пел
Дело не блант, быстро вникал
Снова не тлел и снова скандал
Сколько медалей получат они
За все эти дни ты с визгом гори
Я завис на моменте, скоро узнаешь
Насколько тот день я считаю пропавшим

Ноты забрали меня, c корнем я врос
Не каждый умеет улыбаться сквозь слезы
Но жизнь всех научит, скоро вандал
Окажется в миг у священного зала

Вникай, как трудно меломану
Жить как прежде
Мы тут пробитые

How could you hate me man? I spit about my struggle
And I spit about the hustle
I had pipes in my lung, piercing through the fucking muscle
Bitches talking shit, somebody get a muzzle
You can wait in line, only one can fit the puzzle
I'm surviving in the ends
I ain’t trying to end up dead
My akhi's shotting Z's on a ped in the West
I’m not trying to be like him, I told him ""You do your thing""
I'm trying to make this money hands-free while I'm walking
Ramadan, brothers losing families and lives over dumb shit
The dunya's getting messed, that pretty much sums it
Man committed suicide in Mecca
Rest In Peace, I'm hoping we can all live better
Trendsetter, go-getter
Yeah that's me, I set examples
At your window like Jehovah's if you run off with the samples
I don't need a Carti
Hit the Masjid not a party
I dare a man to touch me because Allah is my army
They just see the clothing, they don’t see the hard work
They just see the image, they don’t know my heart hurts
Word to DVS, the situations are worse
They wanna see red on me, like a Starburst
But I know my path
The only time you'll see me is in a photograph
So you can hold the laugh
I’m not claiming I know the roads, but I know the roads
09, since then I came up on my own
You don't know my life when it was stuck in south
Claiming that I had it easy, shut your fucking mouth
You don't know half, in fact you don't know quarter
Many punctured lungs, I was waiting for the porter
Before you @ me, come with facts B
Leaking lung in the back of a taxi
I had my mama stressed
She’s telling me I'm blessed
Two pipes, fifteen centimetres in my chest
My dad didn't come to visit 'cause he couldn't take it
Smiling on the phone to me, fam he had to fake it
Everyday 11PM, the same text
Praying for you Son, hoping your day's blessed
Waiting for my Mum at like seven in the morning
She stayed with me all night until the nurse gave her warning
That's not half, that's a part of my struggle
So I ask, how could you hate me man? I spit about your life
I don't spit about what's nice
I don't spit about the money or the girls or the ice
Still they tell me that they hate me
Tell me they don't rate me
What do I have to do to make a brudda listen lately?
I'm just trying to make a change 'cause the change made me
Forget what you know, I am not the same G
Don't trust my patience 'cause I'm Asian, you can hold smoke
Leave you limping, hard to walk, something like an old bloke
Don't judge me 'cause I rap
I know akhis shotting crack
Who pray five times, now say something to that
We all have our struggle
Some struggle more than others
But who are we for input? And I put that on my mother's
At the Masjid I was weak
Times were getting peak
Regretting all my sins and I wasn't getting sleep
I left it to my Lord
He left me with a cure
Since then, I've never took my head up off the floor",0.24305120669305325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Но они кричат мне все ""набис""
Я далеко не идеальный, я не изыск
Но если упал с небес, буду непобедим

Совесть душит, но я буду чистым

Если ты упал- это не повод останавливаться
Каждый день ловлю себя на мысли, зачем я это сделал?
Думал, все могло быть как лучше
Но понял, нету смысла жалеть о том, что ушло
Надо жить настоящим и не оглядываться на грехи
Учись на ошибках, получай опыт
Запомни, я поднимусь, потому что я верю в себя!

Future predictions,rap,Areuther,7.0,"In the Next 5 years:
FM stations will move in one of two ways: Either stripped of anything but music or stripped of music and focused all on talk. Radio will function more like movies: Cheap Indies with low costs and lower profit dollars (but higher margins) and expensive blockbusters with high costs and higher profit dollars (and lower margins)

Power will flow to the talent and to the owners of that talent’s distribution. No longer will we expect a talent to do three or four hours, five days a week. We’ll see shorter, less frequent content – repeated more often.  And we’ll see more flavours of content stretched across more distribution channels

Ratings will decline in importance as advertisers make decisions based on accountability and results rather than on how many ears a station reaches. As more dollars that would have gone to radio head to destinations outside Arbitron’s sphere, stations will cancel their Arbitron deals and never look back",0.33137822337448597,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But if we can get free, there's a big bright world to see
Forget about the way it felt before

Try to find some peace in falling out

We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life

You tell me there must be a little light left flickering
Burning in a place we set afire
But no one will listen if we just wait here to burn
We gotta swing away, gotta cut the wire

Try to breathe the air that's here and now
Try to find some peace in falling out

We don't have to say goodbye

Maybe in another life

Hey Truman,pop,CIMINI,191.0,"[Testo di ""Hey Truman""]

[Strofa 1]
Tu pensi di vivere una gran bella vita
Ma godi solo a metà se non ti lecchi le dita
È tutta pubblicità, non si parla di fica
Né dei problemi di etica nella Chiesa Cattolica
Amore, vieni di qua che c'è una vista fantastica
E c'è una rissa in un bar
Con le sue insegne di plastica
In questa Italia che non chiude mai

Voglio ascoltare Battisti su Spotify
Voglio vedere in chiaro i mondiali sulla Rai
Il centro sociale più vicino è la SNAI
La vera povertà fra i grattacieli a Dubai
Forse è come dici tu
Sei il Truman di una serie TV
Tra Red Bull e Ferrari per averе le ali
La carriera in salita, mamma, è promiscuità
E la fedina chе resta pulita
[Ritornello 1]
Una gran bella vita
Una gran bella vita
Io non l'ho ancora capita
E se non esco di casa non restare stupita
Amore, vieni di qua
Ci lecchiamo le dita
Amore, vieni di qua
Che non è ancora finita

[Strofa 2]
L'ottimismo è il profumo
La società di consumo
I buchi neri e il petrolio
Rumeni dai denti d'oro

Di domenica non chiudono mai
Mai, mai, mai

E una sirena che ti aspetta all'uscita

Unky in the trap, playing D till it's locked up
Forgot what time it is, prolly 'cause my watch bust
That is not Runtz, put that 'Wood down
You is not tough, why you tryna put yo foot down?
Damn near a milli' off the raps, I put the juggs down
Paranoid off the Perc', clutching while I look 'round
Twenty-three on me, call this bitch ""LeBron James""
And I got a choppa, let it sing like it's Rod Wave
When I'm chilling, I just play the joggy off the Kanye's
Fourteen hunnid dollar Loubs like it's prom day
Three thousand dollar outfit, call me ""André""
Thirty dollar eighthies, you don't really know how za taste (You don't know)
Poured a two and fell asleep, that's a pop waste
Why the fuck you got shit to say and you ain't got pape'? (What the fuck)

Lungs 'bout blacker than a bitch, I only smoke gas
Shit talker, think my right pocket 'bout yo whole stash
I'm sick you out here down looking so bad

Got the blueprint to win but I ain't coaching y'all (Nah)
Wake up, lace 'em up, all I know is ball
I'm talking Track.2 euro stepping, I ain't no Gasol (Euro stepping)
Woke up and dropped six like I hit three jumpers
Big bankroll full of blues, you a green thumber
I might throw some pinks in this bitch to be a sleeve upper
Throw them ones away, you been playing 'em for three summers
Moncler bubble vest, hit for fifteen Benjis
Scat Packs, Hellcats, Trackhawks, ain't seen Hemis
Ocean Prime or the Eddie V's, I ain't seen Denny's
Hitman on fully, swear to God that he ain't seen semis
Buffs on, blowing out O's like I'm Master Roshi
Pit stop, food truck, lobster in the macaroni
Lil' brodie bad as hell, fucked around and crashed the stolie
I'll send an opp to Neptune, got a blaster on me
High as hell, floating in that spaceship like Captain Kirk
All your 201s dead, never seen no active work
Eight thousand dollar cash if you wanna grab a verse
Tell a bitch tryna talk to me, ""Win a pageant first""
Two, five, eight, can't stop, I'm a hustle junkie
Two hundred clips, if I miss, boy, you double lucky
Stopping at the trap, finna go and see what's up with unky
Supreme drip, T-shirt cost a couple hundy
You ain't seen what I seen, did what I did (You haven't)
You ain't felt what I felt, feel it in my ribs
Grown man money, next year, I'm building me a crib (I swear)
Where the yeah at? Exotic pop chilling in the fridge (Yeah)
Feeling like I'm him (Yeah)
If I hear it's up, shit, I'm sitting on the rim
Missed all his shots, doggy need to get up in the gym (What?)
.223s hit him in his hat, peel it by his brim
I'm a king, feel like Marvin Bagley
You can hear the demon in this bitch when I start the Chally
On the road, finna stop and test one of these cars at Rally's
Hall of Fame deadeye, ain't no way that you guarding Stanley

Energy comes from the sea as long it's running free
Children of all ages breath the earth so naturally
Floating over countries in slow motion like a lotion to feel free

See the children grow up in the times of nowadays
Playing in the back streets with a false smile on their face
Soon they'll grow up, soon they'll show a lazy sometimes crazy detached race

When we try to make a sight of what it's gonna be
We just have to choose between the back streets and the sea
Since we got not real fair choice we better let the whole world to the streams

Cause I don’t clap at the same things anymore

Than to do jack

If you don’t listen to reason
And you don’t listen to logic
And just believe we’re out to get you
Sounds like you’re the real problem
Sad to say it
But I gotta move on
So much growth ahead of me
There’s no room for weeds in this garden
Can’t believe it took me this long to set the boundaries
Just to love myself

Got the doubters second guessing
At the edge of their seats
Your approval doesn’t have the same

Julie Archer,rap,Fiascoo,7458.0,"If you counted how many people actually care and love us
You can have numerous sisters, loads of brothers, unlimited friends, previous lovers, dozens of cousins
But you only get one mother
My mum had two baby daddies
Thats excess baggage
Still, she had a dream that, one day you could still get married
In the meantime, knowing, her self esteem was damaged
I said I'd take her to the Lake District's but then surprised her with Paris
And that was a little appreciation for all that she's done
'Cause for 15 years, she struggled to cope and manage
15 years, I used to ask were dad is
She was scared to tell me 'cause they broke her thumb at my uncle Garry's

On her 49th birthday, took her out to Vermilion
Her dad just died, so we talked about where we gon' bury him
He left some money behind, for my mum and Jilian
And 7 days after that, her uncle died from Middleton
Jesus, you couldn't even write this shit
Chances, two brothers dying in the same week
Like one to a million
Me stressed out
I flew out to the Dominican
I was there for 2 days and got a call from my aunty Jilian
Phone dropped to the floor
I didn't want to hear any more
Sun, sea and sand, didn't want to be here anymore
It was only the previous night, that I said to my father in law, I dont know what grieving feels like, no one died on me before
Close your eyes, Im gonna re-picture the scene
29th of February, 2016
My mum gets a knock on door, 'round about 9:15
She opens it up to her brother, and he asks how have you been
And then he walks in, my sisters up stairs in the bath
He sits down in the living room and starts a casual chat
10 minutes goes by, my mums probably smoking a fag
Suddenly he whips out a petrol bomb from the bag on his back
He sets it alight
Then throws at the floor
It explodes with a bang
As he heads for the door
My mums trapped in the fire, as it spreads up the wall
Spreads to the ceiling, over the chairs and out in the hall
My sister hears loud screaming, she jumps out of the bath
Out of the bedroom window, naked, onto the grass
My mums on fire, she makes it to the garden path
The dog is upstairs barking he can't get out 'cause he's trapped
A helicopter comes to the school to airlift my mum
My emergency flight home was taking 3 days to come
The police, put out a manhunt 'cause he goes on the run
Its national news, Daily Mail, Mirror even the Sun
Its Thursday the 3rd, when I came off the plane
My mum died that night, we never spoken again
If you can hear me now, I just wanted to say
I love you mum, hope to see you again some day",0.3182067070156336,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oh man I had so many chances
Had so many glances
Coulda had a deal by now but my mind was too frantic
I wrote enough songs enough to buy me a mansion
But now I know I'm glad I never dropped anything
It was all a learning curve
Now watch em splurge what I bring
If I had been droppin tapes yall wouldn't care what I spit
If Erratic Genesis had dropped you'd say my debut was shit
Even my homies that know me they knew that labels would stick
And all the teachers and leechers they saw potential I had
And all the creepers beg for features, I walk out on they ass
I'mma do this on my own like I have done in the past
Back when my mama or daddy they couldn't spare me no cash
I had to earn what I wanted, there was no handouts for grabs
My mind was all about the money, you'd say I made Mr. Krabs
In my part of the city we barely made middle class
And I'm a narcissist because my dad would hate on me bad
I had to escape the pain, I liked the rain as a kid
I'd usually sleep at my dads with a big strain in my ribs
I always had this music to take my mind off this shit
I never really felt true love
But I couldn't take my mind off a bitch
But at the end of the day my nigga pussy ain't shit
Be a slave to what you please but please leave this music for me

Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold-shootin' some hoops

A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace

I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin'
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out

Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way

I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said ""Oh, brother.""
I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another
Walkin' home, I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess

And you ain’t fucking with me
If you if you know better
And I'm working all day
Cause I ain't no beggar
And you ain't fucking with me
If you if you know better

[Verse 1: kyincarnate]
I'm at the end of my road
Trying to escape but there's nowhere to go
Hoping that I just don't end up like before
No more friends everybody is a foe
But what do I really know
I'm embarrassed to admit it
But it needs to be admitted
That i’m not the same as i was before
And that’s a given
Laying on the floor wondering if it ever gets better
It gets better
I promise
I was raised by the wolves
But lately man I been feeling like a sheep with a blind shepherd
So I don't really know where we stand but
For the record
If you ever really need someone I’m here
For forever

[Verse 2: locc]
I'm lost in place
Stuck in place
And all the hate
It comes in bulk
And I just wanna hit em all
Like I'm hulk
But I know that won't solve the problem
So I guess I'll go berserk
And lose myself inside my mental
You don't understand the shit that i been through
I be really living life
But you don't live the way I live
You don't fight the way I fight
I be grinding every night
In the studio
I'm looking for me
I got bars and i got melodies
But it ain't mean nothing if you're not down to ride
Cause I need you right here like right by my side
I thought I'd make it
But in my world I'm just anxious
I finally left you and I feel so free
Life is short
Smoking till it's a dork
I made it into the morning
Without feeling unimportant
You could try to bring me back
But I'll just sit here and laugh
You're something from my past
But I won't bring that shit back
[Chorus: YOUNG SHIVA]
What can I say?
Got the cheese the cheddar
And you ain't fucking with me
If you if you know better
And I'm working all day
Cause I ain't no beggar
And you ain't fucking with me
If you if you know better

What can I say?

And you ain't fucking with me

[Verse 3: DAIS.]
I used to not be able to
Get out of bed but now Im flexin without a label
My papa's in construction so I know how to pave the way
It took me awhile but now I'm sitting at the table
For the big kids-
Know your place, What's your strength?
Stand your guard, for your sake— keep it to yourself
Sometimes there will not be immediate benefit but
It's vital to sit down at your now and start penning it, uh
It was hard to be faithful
Had to eat the veggies like a Friday in April
Ongoing process
Shits never painless
Bitch ion steel, but I'm clean like it stainless
I work on the grind and I rap like I made it
I call that a split personality
I'm perfect because I am the total commonality
You think you can spit bro? thats a virtual reality

Spider Smells Disaster,pop,Schatzi (US),25.0,"Drop me off at the corner
I'll find my way there
Fast asleep in the cutter
Smooth like butter

You are all that I detest
Not like you perfect shoes

Banging on the piano
A perfect theme song

And watch it unfold?
And to want more affliction
I hate the friction
Why do I have to lie
To stay here?

And you thought as you rode
To get air in the tires

But they won't wait much more

It's only who you are
And it's what you're all about
But it's hard to keep a focus
Got to get this out
So they wait
Well i'm still waiting for the chance to get out of here
On this frozen lake this ice don't break at all
But the hard part is convincing myself to leave here
I've got my friends and my ghosts

Over with playin'
They won’t understand
How three men from the Eastern Township
Will take control of the map
With no plan, no fans, no radio hits
Stop we’re just starting
They will come in gang with bands to say they’re it
If not guess your taste is shit
And you don’t know what’s great music

Over with doubtin'
As much as I’m over your dabbing
All that stuff is played out
More than that Desiigner song
How you call it Panda
I prefer that Donkey Kong
Live by the law of the jungle
Beg for mercy
Gorilla unit angle of attack
Mingle with them wacks
Will strangle myself before it happens
Say it on this track so there's no way I backtrack
Over with being humble
I never started actually
Thought I was ready to rumble at age of 3
Double that number, already had more rage
Than Kobe mixed with Broly
On my Crowley law
Do what I want
So arrogant
Better learn to love that flaw
Cuz what you think is irrelevant
Will respond haha
If you think your opinion is important
[Verse 2: Herbz]
Have you ever heard of the Eastern Township
I bet you haven’t
Do you even know how hard we go, when it’s time to get lit
I‘m sure you doesn’t
Know how many of you can follow when we do shit
None of you so fuck it
So why there always a bunch of niggas saying the they rep shit
Enough just lose it
We’re Selfish
We don’t give a fuck about everybody else, actually how everybody felt Perish
You’ll never be a full man yourself, if you ain’t got beat by the belt
My wish, I’ll let it melt, new world order, just like Roosevelt
Got a healthy dead president to represent my wealth
Where my boys at, Mortal Kombat
Quick you out your habitat, no chill chat
We’re all about Raw Format, pyramid ain’t flat
Flip mode, so we flip that braaa
I’m the long range sniper, making damage in the corner, one after another
Huge wage, turning page of rage

What we have to do to save this shit huh
Do i gotta go Psycho

When we speaking truth i'm a cool guy
But when it comes to this music i abuse tracks
Like some dudes do crack
I do what i do cuz i'm used to the boom bap
You're challenging a master while it's something that your new at
Through all this wackness we're the realness's replacement
Doing this shit since rapping out my basement
Psyche i'm in my basement still
But being out there ain't gonna make them real
If rap got wounds i can make them heal
Bring forth all it's enemies i can make them kneel
That's my seventh kill, every verse is fucking murderous
The rap Jack the Ripper, i kill em yet they ain't heard of us
When your facing me you should know that i'm never courteous
And that's when i'm calm, imagine when i get furious

That day I discovered you'd given me roots and wings

Roots and wings, gifts of love
Holding me strong and lifting me up
Child of the earth and a rider of the wind
A dreamer of dreams caught in between roots and wings

You weren't standing in my way when I was 18
Letting your heart break and letting me leave
I was headin' my Chevy for the great unknown
Knowing you'd be waiting at the end of that road

Sometimes you've doubted the wisdom of my foolish dreams
You never once denied me my roots and wings

Roots and wings, gifts of love
Holding me strong and lifting me up
Child of the earth and a rider of the wind
A dreamer of dreams caught in between roots and wings
Now part of me wants to stay close to the ground

Aftermath,rock,Adept,824.0,"Life will prevail
As long as the sun still rises
And the sun still sets
My heart will beat and I will survive
I will never be alone again

There comes a day when you need to stand up
And shrug away all doubt inside
Stand strong and push it away

One day you're in, one day you're out
It's called the circle of life
But I know, you rack them up
Then I'll keep on swingin'

Can you see the sun going down
Before your eyes?
The warmth from the lights
That slowly fades out
You're all alone tonight
You buried your heart six feet underground
I hate to say this
But you've lost yourself too many times
And I will not be your comfort when it suits your heart
I'm not alone, I'm stonger, I'm wiser than I ever was with you
So take your fucking shit and leave

There's nothing but a hole in your chest
You scandalous bitch

Can you see the sun going down
Before your eyes?
The warmth from the lights
That slowly fades out
You're all alone tonight
You buried your heart six feet underground

There were millions of times each day
That I thought of you
But we grew up to be nothing like the way that you said
I feel apart when the pieces you stole from me
Made me lost and incomplete

These heavy hearts won't bring me down
We were the ones who would die on the battle ground
At the end of the road I will overcome
You are not me, you will never be this strong
These heavy hearts won't bring me down
We were the ones who would die on the battle ground
At the end of the road I will overcome
You are not me, you will never be this strong",0.43769162241369486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Candide: chapitre VIII french version,misc,Voltaire,228.0,"HISTOIRE DE CUNÉGONDE

« J'étais dans mon lit et je dormais profondément, quand il plut au ciel d'envoyer les Bulgares dans notre beau château de Thunder-ten-tronckh ; ils égorgèrent mon père et mon frère, et coupèrent ma mère par morceaux. Un grand Bulgare, haut de six pieds, voyant qu'à ce spectacle j'avais perdu connaissance, se mit à me violer ; cela me fit revenir, je repris mes sens, je criai, je me débattis, je mordis, j'égratignai, je voulais arracher les yeux à ce grand Bulgare, ne sachant pas que tout ce qui arrivait dans le château de mon père était une chose d'usage : le brutal me donna un coup de couteau dans le flanc gauche dont je porte encore la marque. - Hélas ! j'espère bien la voir, dit le naïf Candide.
- Vous la verrez, dit Cunégonde ; mais continuons.
- Continuez », dit Candide.

Elle reprit ainsi le fil de son histoire : « Un capitaine bulgare entra, il me vit toute sanglante, et le soldat ne se dérangeait pas. Le capitaine se mit en colère du peu de respect que lui témoignait ce brutal, et le tua sur mon corps. Ensuite il me fit panser, et m'emmena prisonnière de guerre dans son quartier. Je blanchissais le peu de chemises qu'il avait, je faisais sa cuisine ; il me trouvait fort jolie, il faut l'avouer ; et je ne nierai pas qu'il ne fût très bien fait, et qu'il n'eût la peau blanche et douce ; d'ailleurs peu d'esprit, peu de philosophie : on voyait bien qu'il n'avait pas été élevé par le docteur Pangloss. Au bout de trois mois, ayant perdu tout son argent et s'étant dégoûté de moi, il me vendit à un Juif nommé don Issacar, qui trafiquait en Hollande et en Portugal, et qui aimait passionnément les femmes. Ce Juif s'attacha beaucoup à ma personne, mais il ne pouvait en triompher ; je lui ai mieux résisté qu'au soldat bulgare. Une personne d'honneur peut être violée une fois, mais sa vertu s'en affermit. Le Juif, pour m'apprivoiser, me mena dans cette maison de campagne que vous voyez. J'avais cru jusque-là qu'il n'y avait rien sur la terre de si beau que le château de Thunder-ten-tronckh ; j'ai été détrompée.

« Le grand inquisiteur m'aperçut un jour à la messe, il me lorgna beaucoup, et me fit dire qu'il avait à me parler pour des affaires secrètes. Je fus conduite à son palais ; je lui appris ma naissance ; il me représenta combien il était au-dessous de mon rang d'appartenir à un Israélite. On proposa de sa part à don Issacar de me céder à monseigneur. Don Issacar, qui est le banquier de la cour et homme de crédit, n'en voulut rien faire. L'inquisiteur le menaça d'un auto-da-fé. Enfin mon Juif, intimidé, conclut un marché, par lequel la maison et moi leur appartiendraient à tous deux en commun : que le Juif aurait pour lui les lundis, mercredis et le jour du sabbat, et que l'inquisiteur aurait les autres jours de la semaine. Il y a six mois que cette convention subsiste. Ce n'a pas été sans querelles ; car souvent il a été indécis si la nuit du samedi au dimanche appartenait à l'ancienne loi ou à la nouvelle. Pour moi, j'ai résisté jusqu'à présent à toutes les deux, et je crois que c'est pour cette raison que j'ai toujours été aimée.

« Enfin, pour détourner le fléau des tremblements de terre, et pour intimider don Issacar, il plut à monseigneur l'inquisiteur de célébrer un auto-da-fé. Il me fit l'honneur de m'y inviter. Je fus très bien placée ; on servit aux dames des rafraîchissements entre la messe et l'exécution. Je fus, à la vérité, saisie d'horreur en voyant brûler ces deux Juifs et cet honnête Biscayen qui avait épousé sa commère ; mais quelle fut ma surprise, mon effroi, mon trouble, quand je vis, dans un san-benito et sous une mitre, une figure qui ressemblait à celle de Pangloss ! Je me frottai les yeux, je regardai attentivement, je le vis pendre ; je tombai en faiblesse. À peine reprenais-je mes sens que je vous vis dépouillé tout nu : ce fut là le comble de l'horreur, de la consternation, de la douleur, du désespoir. Je vous dirai, avec vérité, que votre peau est encore plus blanche et d'un incarnat plus parfait que celle de mon capitaine des Bulgares. Cette vue redoubla tous les sentiments qui m'accablaient, qui me dévoraient. Je m'écriai, je voulus dire : "" Arrêtez, barbares ! "" mais la voix me manqua, et mes cris auraient été inutiles. Quand vous eûtes été bien fessé : « Comment se peut-il faire, disais-je, que l'aimable Candide et le sage Pangloss se trouvent à Lisbonne, l'un pour recevoir cent coups de fouet, et l'autre pour être pendu par l'ordre de monseigneur l'inquisiteur dont je suis la bien-aimée ? Pangloss m'a donc bien cruellement trompée quand il me disait que tout va le mieux du monde. »

« Agitée, éperdue, tantôt hors de moi-même, et tantôt prête de mourir de faiblesse, j'avais la tête remplie du massacre de mon père, de ma mère, de mon frère, de l'insolence de mon vilain soldat bulgare, du coup de couteau qu'il me donna, de ma servitude, de mon métier de cuisinière, de mon capitaine bulgare, de mon vilain don Issacar, de mon abominable inquisiteur, de la pendaison du docteur Pangloss, de ce grand miserere en faux-bourdon pendant lequel on vous fessait, et surtout du baiser que je vous avais donné derrière un paravent, le jour que je vous avais vu pour la dernière fois. Je louai Dieu qui vous ramenait à moi par tant d'épreuves. Je recommandai à ma vieille d'avoir soin de vous, et de vous amener ici dès qu'elle le pourrait. Elle a très bien exécuté ma commission ; j'ai goûté le plaisir inexprimable de vous revoir, de vous entendre, de vous parler. Vous devez avoir une faim dévorante ; j'ai grand appétit ; commençons par souper. »

Les voilà qui se mettent tous deux à table ; et après le souper, ils se replacent sur ce beau canapé dont on a déjà parlé ; ils y étaient quand le signor don Issacar, l'un des maîtres de la maison, arriva. C'était le jour du sabbat. Il venait jouir de ses droits, et expliquer son tendre amour.",0.6088182264162848,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Babel Babel,pop,Blood Ruby,34.0,"Shuttled through narrow gaps
All these walls line our trap
Brick and steel, glass, concrete
No more field and no more tree

Babel Babel rising
Cleaves the air
Babel Babel winding
Climbs the stair
Baby baby, listen
Can't you hear?
Babble babble
Is the language here

Windows stack ladder lines;
In between, the gutters climb
Edges cut, corners meet;
Angles tear at the angel's wings

High above checkered streets
Pitch the roof at the peak
Pigeon coo, patch of blue
Pinhole sun in a penthouse room
Babel Babel
Rising cleaves the air

Winding climbs the stair
Baby baby, listen

Braying in my ears

Higher still, raise the cranes;
Lift us up beyond our fate
Kiss the mouth of heaven's bell
From the pinnacles of hell

One more floor, two more feet;
Always just out of reach
One more brick, almost there;
Vanish in the thinning air

Ya no son las 4 y pico, aun esta lloviendo
Lo siento nena perdí la mente en el viento
No sé desde hace cuanto ya no te quiero
No sé cuando dejaste de ser mi complemento

Habrá alguien mejor que pronto ocupe el templo
Alguien que sin medidas ames con el tiempo
Harás lo que no pudiste y cada vez me lamento
Por no poder ser parte y llegar lejano al tempo

Por estar ausente y no darte un te quiero
Por ser distante y no mostrar sentimientos
Por ser un cobarde y verte solo de reflejo
No me siento mal y tu hiciste lo correcto

No sé si pronto podré amanecer contento
Pues aún estas cada que veo un espejo
No se si sea por lo complejo o mi miedo
Soy un simple terrenal que se mantiene viendo
Por favor promete que estaré completo
No me gusta sufrir por llevarte dentro
Como si algo me mantuviera preso
Te dije lo difícil que soy y mis complejos

Te dejo parte de mi corazón y mi cerebro
Llévalos siempre, ellos te quieren, créelo
No me arrepiento por este sentimiento
Me arrepiento por dejarte irte lejos

Pienso, que si no crezco no seré bueno
Pienso, que no soy el complejo eterno
Pienso, que si te sigo voy a valer menos

Pienso, que todo esto en mi es perpetuo
Pienso, que ya no debo seguir viendo

Focus on money, you focus on me, what y'all about

Ain't even gon' lie, she showed me a dope time

Could be where I was at two years ago with no time

But I smoke niggas, I’m addictive, get the bitches wet
I got a joke for you: money - y'all don’t get it yet?

Będziesz walczyć z mym demonem
Obudzę się i będzie już po tobie
A chciałbym z tobą jeszcze zamienić słowem (słowo)

Truth!
Truth!
Truth, where are you?!

[Verse 1]
Yeah
They say truth ain't rocking in the youth
Slate me, erase me popping in the booth
But the doowops can't stop hopping in the noose
Swip swap they got you crashing in the coupe oooo
Already flown before they put you on
The only thing going for you is gone
What you own?
Blown chances, No answers
Hang time no mind me advances over what you make
Before you sort through what is fake
Flip flop, can't got what you never made ooooo

[Chorus]
Truth is truth
There's only one way to perceive it
And a lie is a lie
No matter how strong you believe it
Yeah yeah
[x2]
Yeah yeah yeah (Allright, Allright, Allright...)
Yeah it's gonna take the best of all to break me
The rest involved taking some shakey, wish washy
Damn that's all very costly
""All very sad man they almost got me""
But they did!
Kid yourself and laugh about it hard
Prostituting bars constituting the marge
Harsh to see what they took
Oldest pimp in the book
Hooker yourself for some hooks
Look twice! Oh you didn't?
Allright let's see who isn't sweating over sales
None left or right to go on and help Ah!
Damn they straight pimping you out
Spitting that word of the mouth
Cmon man. were just finding them out

And a lie is a lie
No matter how strong you believe it

Weither what weather may come
Either together or none
If whatever is never and my presence is none
Sever ever there was me to begun
Or begin, or became who I am, who I was, what was then
Then again who was I to reign the weather?
It's easy to criticize but harder to do better
So if I ever forget that and they say that I'm whack, whack, whack
Then proceed to just smack, smack yourself right in the head
If you can't compete then repeat and do it again
Apprehend your apps in applause
Pretty sad we got apps but not some apps for some jobs
Apples to apples shackle for slobs
Razzle dazzle a hassle but the battle is lost
Why? Because the war is raging
While I'm steady pacing whilst there steady changing the station
Don't touch that dial!
Embrace me boy I'll be here for awhile
I'll be here with the swoon, see the junebug zoom
Raining on your parade and snowing on your summer afternoon
Ah Ah Ah I'll still be running when you ran out of luck
Ah Ah Ah all the while still not give a fuck
HOLD UP!
""Didn't I say yall are whack?
Naw I can't be jamming to this, yall got me tripping""
AHEM!
Didn't care if you did or you didn't
You can't deny your soul if you can't vibe what was written
If it was given and you can't stop tap-tap-tapping your feet
It's gotten if it's forgotten and you won't let it breath
You can can say we ain't nothing but we still put in something for you
OOOOOO
And I don't care anymore you just can't ignore the truth
OOOOOO
They got yo ass yeah
They gonna get ya bad
Yeah
They never gonna hold back
Everything you know that
Can't save ya, It's already done

La mort sifflera trois fois,rock,Romain Humeau,37.0,"La mort sifflera trois fois
Par les trois orifices
De ce jardin qui est le tien
Le jardin des délices

La mort sifflera trois fois
Comme le vent dans les flûtes
La litanie de l'os
Fendant l'air des allées d'Aulos

La mort sifflera trois fois
Par la Sainte Trinité binaire
De ce plat pays qui est le mien
Egorgé par les zéros les uns

La mort sifflera trois fois
Des abbesses aux abysses
Enchaînées, déchaînées
Jusqu'à c'qu'elles couinent et jouissent

La mort sifflera trois fois
Dans les millieux aqueux
Et les porcs dans la crèche
Savent qu'vous êtes tous de mèche
La mort sifflera trois fois
Les trains grondent dans les corps
Pendant que le mien si frêle
Devine l'envers de ton décor

La mort sifflera trois fois
Comme le serpent qui suppute
Perquisition de l'arrière boutique
De ta connasse en rut
Nous convergerons vers la souille
Gerbant le sang du Christ
Et les effluves de nos couilles
Embaumeront la surface des kystes

J'enculerai ton hygiène mentale
Snoberai tes machoires vaginales
Les ronces qui poussent entre mes côtes
Viendront déranger ton bocal

Et le cauchemar se prolonge
Renifle et grogne en nos arrières
Un oui, un non et on s'allonge
Pourvu qu'ce soit dans un cimetière

Je perçois au lointain comme des rires
Des bouches de salopes qu'on opère
Craquent les incisives, les molaires
De ta chère enfant qui expire
La mort sifflera trois fois
Par des yeux abolis
Couteau dans l'dos qu'un ami plante
L'a dû confondre l'ortie et l'hostie

Ses pupilles noires crachent des aiguilles
Viennent faire crisser mes vertébrales
Tout en déchirant tes annales
De pissotières en bas résilles

Suicide collectif, la gériatrie
Vous la trouviez pourtant si humaine
Mais rien ne sert de parler de magnifique
Le mal est fait, la vie se traîne

Les forces de la mort
Fondent au petit matin
Grêle de crânes
Cristallins

Je t'ai vu
Sacrifié sur l'autel du mal-être
Pompant
Les vomissures de leurs urêtres
Aucun moyen d'éviter
Les affres de la dernière extrémité
La mort sifflera trois fois

Où nonnes et squelettes
Frottent leurs culs aux triques

Let me tell you a story about a boy and a girl
It's kinda short, kinda boring, but the end is a whirl
They were just sixteen when the people were mean
So they didn't love themselves, and now they're gone
Headstones on a lawn

[Verse 2]
And when I was younger, I knew a boy and a boy
Best friends with each other, but always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one another, but never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say
Moved to different states

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
[Verse 3]
Now it's on to the sequel about me and my friend
Both our parents were evil, so we both made a bet
If we worked and we saved, we could both run away
And we'd have a better life, and I was right
I wonder if she's alright

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
Okay

[Bridge]
And the movie's always runnin' in my head
All the people, all the lovers, all my friends
And I hope that they all get their happy end
In the end

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works

Number seven's where we went and played our first ever gig
Our history slides down a pint glass and my head's getting thin
So call Last Orders and get them in

Number eight is full of farewell friends
Number nine's changed too much so drink your drinks and then we're

You betrayed me, you killed my soul

I've crossed the line
No way out
False promises
There is no future!
I am left alone
I am left alone

Forever imprisoned
In this endless maze
Where thе walls
Are made of madness and pain
That kills us
And еvery single day
Lasts forever

I am to blame
For everything

Lifeline,rock,Fire From the Gods,5397.0,"Here comes doubt again saying I’m not good enough
Look at all the things that you’ve done wrong for so long
I built my own personal hell, searched the world for answers and found nothing
Oh well. It was on me to conquer the fear that was killing me and find the fighter inside

This is the only thing that keeps me breathing. I traded my pain and ignorance, when all hope is lost I live again

Have you seen the edge, have you ever walked the ledge? I have stared into the depths, there was nothing staring back at me but my body, lifeless. Caught somewhere between heaven and hell, of the stories I could tell, I’d rather not, but oh well here it is. Here’s to me and the person I used to be. Now here comes my past again to devour me

You’re not an individual, you’re a mindless, selfish, indulgent animal. You’re all alone, broken without a soul, left with nothing to call your own

This is the only thing that keeps me breathing. I traded my pain and ignorance, when all hope is lost I live again

I remember those days of pain when I was on my knees, pleading to the heavens for a god to come rescue me. Pray to thin air, it was just as I feared, my prayers fell on deaf ears. It took some time, but I woke up and found a lifeline screaming “wake up and open your eyes” (bring me back to life)

Strawberry,country,Paul Baribeau,28477.0,"To say that you are cute
Would be like saying that a strawberry is sweet
Because a strawberry has secret flavors
That are sharp, and tart, and red, and deep

And I would love to find you
Growing wild out by the woods
I would make a basket with the front of my t-shirt
And take home as many of you as I could

And to say that you are pretty
Would be like saying that the ocean is blue
Because the ocean is filled with all kinds of colors
And I see all kinds of things when I look at you

And I want to explore you
With my tennis shoes off
Standing ankle deep in a tide pool with my khaki pants rolled up

And to say that you are funny
Would be like saying that the night sky is black
Because the night sky is filled with stars and comets
And planets that no one has seen yet
And I want to look at you
Lying down on my front lawn
I'll try to take you all in at once
But you just go on and on and on",0.6563041675835848,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Against the edge, in around my head

Old Virginia Block,pop,Devon Sproule,122.0,"If my ears hear a sigh of a shiny red violin
Clear by the Rivanna, down in the Blue Ridge
By the dog bags and trash, by the bottles and cans
And the dead beat brown grass
And the red dirt in the Blue Ridge
Then my home must be around another good old Virginia block

If my ears hear a note on the cello, so low, then a double stopping bow
From my headphones, in the Blue Ridge
Out walking at noon, appearing under the white of the daytime moon
Keeping my big blue balloon in my tight fist, in the Blue Ridge
Then my home must be around another good old Virginia block

If my ears hear the sound of a slate rock on the ground
Clicking the drops of the rain coming down, along a front walk, in the Blue Ridge
The rim of dirt on the brim of a brow, the skin of sweat on the handle of a plow
Miles and miles of tobacco in the south, from a back road, in the Blue Ridge
Then my home must be around another good old Virginia block

I've got family in Canada, family in New York
I've got friends in every other place I've played
But I can't keep from planting all my plans of family stuff
Down between the weeds in the red dirt clay
And where my ears hear a hundred bees riding that upwarding breeze
A veil and a bucket by a pair of oak trees
Just another blond kid, in the Blue Ridge
It's all to make a pattern of love, to roost a lava field of white doves
With just a pitch fork and a pair of thick gloves
For your whole life, in the Blue Ridge
The pick up and go - the bent back and the grunt-chucked coal
The gleam of your white underclothes, in the back seat, in the Blue Ridge
The pile of bacon by a couple fried eggs, kiss marks and hearts on a picnic table leg
The quartet fretting on up in my head, on my long walk, through the Blue Ridge
And my home comes up around another good old Virginia block",0.5479871425777674,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Это посттравматический синдром, ты о чём? (П-Т-С-Р)
Это посттравматический синдром, ха, ха

[Куплет 1]
Я не увижу прежний мир (Сага!)
Как будто донор дал глаза (Глаза)
Хорошо, когда отребье
Керчь не мутит второй раз (Второй раз)
Ведь тут — перебивки молодых стай
Тусклые биксы устали мечтать:
Что если все это — просто угар
Горизонт никогда не откроется вдаль?
В стенах из пламени мы закаляемся: (Окей)
С дулом у лба каждый станет понятливым
Максимум травм, но я — не инвалид
3x3 глаза — меня не убить!
Мои пацаны, от судьбы не уйдёшь!
Не глядя в лицо ей — ты просто ссыкло! (Эй-эй-эй)
Сколько ты стоишь, когда рядом деньги?
Был дорогим, но ушёл за копейки

[Куплет 2]
Не якшаюсь с мудачьём (Совсем), потешаюсь над врагом (Всегда)
Каждый, кто нас осуждал сегодня будет осуждён
Ум забит деньгами, как камера в швейцарском банке (Очень много)
Не умею опускать руки, будто бы распят
Окна вниз, пацаны дымят (Дымят), тут никто не спит (Спит)
На лице — отпечаток драм (Драм): мы — не тюфяки!
Набери тем красивым дамам, нужен позитив
Я все время улыбаюсь, не болтаю что внутри
Я вожу воду на клоунских группах
Вы пацаны — суки, раз судите в чувствах
Никак иначе, я должен кататься
На гривах уёбков, клевещущих в массы
Нахуй респекты! Я — ветеран действий!
Плевать, что ты слышал, ты не был на месте меня
Когда тьма атакует, ведь я устоял, но травма
Навечно оставила шрам
[Припев]
Посттравматический синдром —
Твой надёжный компаньон!
Он всегда идёт с тобой
В списках тусы — плюс лицо
Посттравматический синдром —
Лютый пламень и мороз
Это — главный парадокс
Ибо холодно и жжёт!

Теряю сон часто, будто в окопе

Ctrl Alt Del,rb,Lucid (Lucasislucid),34.0,"[Chorus]
I'm dropping on the ground in my Civic
Dropping in the Nighthawk, to be specific
I need to know if you are really with this

[Verse]
You say I'm acting silly, but is it serious?
Yes it is

These memories haunt my dreams
These memories haunt my dreams
I can't fall asleep
I can't fall asleep
Cause then I'll dream


[Verse]
Unfollowed, you been deleted
My mind ctrl alt deleted
Left behind what was defeated
Eggbeaters, I'd leave it and watch it think
Conceited
Can't unsee what you trying to hide in your drink
Can I get a quick peak at it for like four weeks?
Where everything's great and fine and I'm burning trees
You lay inside and wait for me
But you carrying a weight I see
But you remind me of how Karen was when
She was about to leave
And come to think of it, there's a few things
That seem concerning to me...
(Dropping in on the ground)
Like I know this lesson, learned it
Dwelled on it and burned in
A memory... a burden...
I put down for love
I'm hurting
You flirting and lurking
Like I can't lean like a turkey
Swerve red flags like jerky

The plan was clear but your mud makes water murky
Try to make you understand but next time you see me smirking
A lamb to the slaughter for your sings but I'm the one with the mercy
I'm just telling facts, dropping lead, but I'm not even cursing
I'm shaking the ground of the temples that you once worshipped:

Fear. Anger. Hatred

Saying it's not a good fit
Sick of all these people saying you're not worth it
Like you read it but you said you haven't heard it
You think your version of me's perfect?
You think I'm perfect?
You think you perfect?


[Verse]
Can I trust you with my life baby?
Can I trust you to be my wife baby?
Can I trust you with my child baby?
Think I'll think on it a while okay oh ayy
I think I'll think on it a while
No distractions

I'm dropping on the ground in my Civic
Dropping in the night, dropping in the night
Dropping in the night, dropping in the night
Dropping in the night...
I need to know if you are really with this
(Are you really with it? But are you really with it?)

Why you tripping on this honest nursery?
Caesar's death-- my birth
Y'all tried to murder me
(Y'all tried to murder me.)
I'm too crazy with no lane-- insane
It's only me vs. me
Paper fake, but the players trying to purchase me
They tell me what to do and wear -- it starts a lurch in me
Inside a darkness lurks and he hasn't been to church in weeks

You should've gave me some way to breathe
You should've gave me some way

I don’t really know if I can give you any more
If I can give you any more
I’m just gonna take it there

Where were you when I needed you?
I didn’t think you’d fly that night (Fly that night)
Nah, It wasn’t you when I looked at you
It was someone else
You’d always smile but you needed help
Weight became too heavy so you dropped yourself (You dropped yourself)
It wasn’t you when I looked at you
No, it was someone else

This downcast with no lure out
Such a shame

I don’t really like how you operate now
You know it’s the same old conversation
You don’t have to see it my way
But, that's real and that ain’t gonna change

I don't really know if I can give you any more

Circle of Tyrants
Circle of Tyrants
Attack you like the Dawn of the Dead

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
I sent you all to Satan
Sent you to the devil, decapitated
Splattered, degraded
Rather amazing matters of hatred
Manifestation
The cannibal data related to random standards in cases
Fuckin' faggots stabbed in they faces
Buckets of acid
Hitchhike with truckers in traffic
I'm stuck on a path where the outcome is nothing but tragic
My outward appearance is nothing but average
Inside of my brain structrure the primary function is madness
Torture these traitors
Put their blow torches to faces
Corpses in my basement
Torsoes are my favorite
Autopsy's invigorating
Killing you is refreshling and liberating
Playing with the dead is extensively titilating
Humans are extremely expensive but really tasty
Sell you on the Black Market in pieces to anybody who pays me
Limited quantity
Culinary sodomy
Unique cuisine, delicacy
The ultimate equality
[Verse 2: Necro]
I'm Ogrish
As vulgar as you can get
Cut out your vulva
My cult of the dead
Eats from your skull
Pulverize like a vulture's molars
My goal is dicing up Cindy Margolis
And placing her flesh on slices and servin' you hemoglobinisis
Its priceless
I'm savage, artistic like the vampire of Paris
Sadistic
Start a campfire
Reminisce of massacres lifted
Blast through a pillow
I'm a sick bastard like Andre Chikatilo
Slay the padre
Watch the silhouette of a killer glow
Dusted like Repka's artwork
Like Carcass' ""Heartwork""
Like an aardvark searchin' through organs like carparts rockin' a Cardhardt
Ritual sacrifice is human appetizers
I capitilize on this cannibalism violence advertisements
My cypher of tyrants are trifer than pirates
Like lifers that killed wifey with knives
A violent viking's in Ice Age
Smacking Satan
Invading your crib like Patrick Bateman
With a hatchet waiting making a theatric statement
[Verse 3: Goretex]
They call me Fondlecorpse
Cater for every occasion
Home invasion
Cavin' in brains
That's what I call entertainment
Anachronistic
Wit' two biscuits that clip through your discus
The gore grinder
Cause I'm down to the last 6 on my hit-list
I'm a sick kid
Pieces of skull and blood on my ticksis
Too much brown acid
Used to be in love with the business of killings
Stitching the scalp of another innocent victim
Buried face down
You're similar to a faggot who takes it in him
Basically a waste of skin
I've returned and sent him a telegram
A body count with two legs
Shattered next to the hexagram
My handy cammin'
I make like squeaky and stab it
My circle fam is supreme bandits
Murdered like speed handlers
Dirt on the canvas
Torso fuck shorter than Danzig
Saw off your legs and walk on your hands like you was dancin'
March of the pigs
Newest shipments, cartons of wigs
The killer's smile
You know the symptoms when the coughing begins
[Verse 4: Mr. Hyde]
The prince of evil erupts
Cut you cunts into cutlets
You fuckin' faggot punks
A bunch of sluts that'll suck dick
We bust clips at cops
And trust kids with Glocks
We'll thrust in the ox of puss, drips and drops
Rockin' bloody bone chains and veins
My cult's strange
Known to indulge in pain
Crack skulls, expose brains
While God's forsaken me there's carcass cooking in my bakery
Scraping off your skin and string it up my wall as drapery
Dramatically battering you
Emphatically splattering you
Sporadically ravaging like a scavanger do
Sharpen claws
Ripped and tore your shit
You're dead and sure to twitch, bitch
Your blood and piss is pouring out of every orifice
Corpse grisly and grim
I use my scissors to trim
The blue corset from the host
As I efficiently skin
Spin the record around
I chop your ventricles down
You'll see my tentacles found you
Now you enter the ground

Evet, evet (Hey, hey, hey)
Evet, hey-ey-ey

[Verse 1]
Unutmadım
Sadece birkaç yıl önceydi beni suçlamaya kalktın
Sen bana yanlış yaptın, unutmayacağımı bilmelisin
Telefon bir mesaj yüzünden kavga ettiğimiz evin kenarına koyuldu
Unutamam, hayır (Hayır)
Yanımda olduğunu düşündüm, bu büyük bir yalanmış
Unutamam, hayır
Hepsini geride bırakmalıyım, iyiymiş gibi davranarak (Evet)
Bu gece para saçıyorum (Evet), onun aklımdan atmak için (Ah)
Lütfen kafamı dağıt ve kalçanı yana salla (Oh)
Beni azdır, bunu yapabildiğini biliyor
Bu gece zengin adam için kötü seçim, o yalanlarıma yara bandı oluyor
Evet, değiştim, aynı kalamazdım
Sadece şikayet еtmeyi seviyorsun ve acımı asla hissеtmiyorsun
Yağmurda beni yalnız bıraktın, utancın adını tam koy (Hayır)
Bu oyunları oynamayı seviyorsun, düğmeme bas, bu delice
Bir lekeye büründün, yıkansan da gitmeyecek (Evet)
Bana inancımı sorgulattı (Oh) neredeyse aklımı kaçıracaktı (Oh)
Bir trenin önüne atladım, Tanrı'ya şükür ki kurtuldum
Asla unutmayacağım, hayatla yüzleştim
Kızarıyorum, yüzüm terle kaplı
Ölmeyi diliyorum
Bu oyunları oynuyorsun, aklımdan siktir ol git
Karmakarışık hissediyorum
Çığlık atıyorum, gittiğin günü düşünüyorum
Onları yatakta yakaladım
Sen, asla unutmayacağımı bilmelisin, asla (Wouh)
Beni bu tarafa ittin ve kenarda bıraktın
Asla ve asla unutmayacağımı bilmelisin, asla (Wouh)
Hayatımın en zayıf kısmında beni hata yapmaya ittin
Kızım bu asla unutamayacağım bir şey
Yalan yok, gülüşünü özledim, dudaklarını da
Evinde gülerdik de ağlardık da
Ne değişti, fikrin yanımdan ayrılmak mı?
Yemin ederim ki çok yoruldum, şehirden kaçtım
Ayrılmanı izledim, ayrılmanı
Öldür beni, öldür
Hayır, hayır, hayır, hayır (Hayır)
Gittiğin geceyi, asla unutmayacağım
Strese girmeme sebep oldun, en iyisi olmasa da
Yalanlarından bıktım, seksten değil
Son bir kez 69 yapalım, baştan sağma değil
Bu çift taraflı olay, bana saygı göster
Bu parayla ilgili değil, çekle ilgili değil
Her zaman yatırım yapmak zorunda kaldım
Yapabileceğim her şeyi yaptım
Günlerce beni burada yalnız bıraktın
Seni yanımda özledim ama şimdi tek gördüğüm
Beni boğmaya çalıştığın (Boğ beni, bebeğim)
Üzerimden siktir git
Beni pençelemeye çalıştın (Vay)
Telefonumu aramaya çalıştım ve unut gitsin (Prr, merhaba)
Yemin ederim ki seviyorum, her zaman da unutmaya çalışıyorum (Unut onu)
Bebeğim yalnız kalmaktan korkuyordum ama artık geçti
Sadece kalkıp dışarıya çık ve korkularımla yüzleş artık zor değil
Sadece gösteriş yapmak istiyorum
Yemin ederim ki her şey için çok geç olduğunda seni umursuyorlar
Ve birinin artık öldüğünü anlıyorlar
Ve beni seven birini buldum
Onu, para saymayı sevdiğim kadar seviyorum
Bu gerçek (Asla unutmayacağım)
Bil ki (Asla unutmayacağım)
Güvenin dışında hiçbir şey yok (Asla unutmayacağım)

All the nights that I put in work
While you stayed asleep
Now I'm somebody you would kill to be
An ill MC, and will I go wildebeest
Unleash the artillery
Like my brother with an M16, the marine
He taught me when your back's to the wall and you feel that heat
You're not quitting, we gotta be on top of the industry
Like hot-diggity-dog
You motherfuckers I be killing them off
Like Oswald when he shot Kennedy
The semi-automatic hit them like a Glock 17
Eliminate the enemy
You'd never would ever be ahead of me
No reaching the pedigree of a level three felony
Oh no, serenity, my flows could readily bulldoze
Motherfuckers you were supposed to fight
When there wasn't no hope in life
Used to rap with the open mic
But nobody liked what I had to say
I coulda went ghost at night
Like poltergeist
That I took no advice
Took a chance and I rolled the dice
When people showed no love, cold and white
Just give them hell 'til they melt
Like motherfucking frozen ice
And looking back I'm still amazed
Overcame darker days
Countless fights, lot of people who walked away
Even if I'm all alone
When they come for me in my damn home
I send the dog while I load the gun
And I kill them all 'cause it's in my bones

What is your rap name, Lil -
Something Lil bitch boy
Maybe that I fit more than yours now
Rappers getting shittier, it's hard for me to pinpoint how
Just when I thought it was impossible to get dumbed down
Anymore than it already is
I done contemplated calling it quits once again
Every time I see a trend come around
Ain't about being young or
Lyrical, sick of those typical tones
Hear the same accent
Hard from me to tell where you're from
Never thought I'd say this, but I really miss Lil Jon (Yeah)
No hate, but I feel the same way
Cause I did so then every artist better tempo switch
Tryna get those spins from a sound in the ground
Thought it couldn't get worse, but it did times ten (times ten)
Infinity, it's progressively worse
I guess I let sentiment bother me when I was young I had to put in hours of my time to be the best and made to get respect for my word
I love to get goosebumps when I feel real shit
I don't care about how clever the words
But instead thirty seconds of verse full of sound effects
Now I gotta hit them with the ""yah""s (skrr)

Y'all niggas want smoke with the big bad wolf come ’n try your luck
If you clip the wrong cord blow this (hoe?) to smithereens, we just wired up
I been riding through the city with a couple hoes on me I'm a fire truck
Get your whole hood puttin' lighters up
Never knew your mum would have cried this much
Keep it quiet son, I need silence, I need focus
(Peel off then load this?)
Your bitch buzz like she a locust
Take a lesson why don't you learn you been out with the dopest
Box a nigga like he (stole fish?)
Roll him up, and them I smoke him, it was a dead Pope ring
Ding dong like the hostess
Niggas at ya front door we doing the Moses
Kill a thing, off his head with the guillotine
Gave a dose and now she still a fiend
I'ma strike rich off the illest schemes
If he up I am still in lead
I was creeping a lot to the front like a millipede
Got a bag from the Philippines
Kiss your (?).... and say
Mash you a realer scene
Man y'all niggas trap the while backwards
Yappin' like actors
If these liars, were some frat brothers they be Kappa Phi Kappa
I'm back and I’m snappin’
Put an NY patch on my cactus
Need a hoe and a pack of fried catfish
Anybody tryin'a clap or fly savage?
Lookin’ good yo, let the niggas sow
Pass the (bikkie?) like a (?)
Down the mic how to stick a blow
Steppin' with the bird it's a pigeon toe
Pull a heist off, put on different clothes
Millimetre got a different nose
A gorilla even when I spit as slow
'Cause these niggas streaming all these different flows
Tell Joyner Lucas, Tory, Token, Noel ’n Jokerz that I'm comin' for the top spot
I'm a vulture poachin' posers so they know it's over 'cause I'm comin' with it non stop
I put a nigga in the palm box
I put a bullet line front of a nigga this is where the line stops
I got a photo make ya mom pop
And hit your liver like a shot of liquor, lickin' (where the lime drops?)
So come and rap with the raptorz
I kill a nigga with a verse and return him like I'm back on the track to attack on the masses
So get your vest so I can make an example of all my tactical (?), you lapse I'ma spazz
Flack 'cause I'm black with a knack for disaster, stash stacks and I put 'em black backs to the plaster
Get your riches and your rags stashed from the (master?)
And turn a nigga to a red stack for my laughter
Hardy, harty ha this shit is hysterical
These niggas tryin'a mimic my miracles
(?) try to give my shit is imperial

Wrist frozen
Go on rap tours 'til we find a garage to put the Rolls in
Tell ya entourage I goes in
Shooters outside ya aunt's garage, you owe him
What you expect?
Every shot'll be silent, you in debt
In debt, the B is silence
And in the B-X, we known for bein' violent
Clap that heat, everybody they gon' squeeze
Like cheap ass seats, everybody he knows bleeds
Ha, we gon' see
New York City, I'm what your flow needs
And knowin' the streets fuck with you
And I never sold my soul, I can sleep comfortable
Give you parents credit, that blow, they keep comin' through
You'll pay 'til ya mother clear, Denise Huxtable
Gordo writin' again
Why I wasn't on the cypher again?
I don't know, I just know not many rappers is nicer than him
I bring that metaphor life to the pen
I'm tryin' to win like Hurricane Matthew doin'
Pills slow, I hurry 'caine, what math you doin'?
If it's 'bout a dollar you can hit me, new feel
In my pocket, Monica Lewinsky, blue bill

Early morning stove like six somethin'
Break it down to O's 'cause the strip bubblin'

I can put you on your feet or put you under six of 'em, huh
Regardless I'm the hardest artist ever as far as bars is
Cartridge hit you cartilage
This infra-red light'll turn a dark skin dude to the DeBarges
Who want it with me?
My shooters carry two 4-5's like a quarter to three
Can't tell what I might spit
Like Pippen in Salt Lake City, I carry the mic sick

All of my thoughts become my path
And I am limitless at last

Love is broken and opened my heart
And it is always just the start

All of my life
Holding on too tight
Now I must let go
I'll spend the rest of my life
So much left in it
Just let go

We are all running out of time
But the universe is mine
Under a blood moon or a sun
I know that I've only begun

And for every sad goodbye
There will be a sweet surprise
All of my life
Holding on too tight
Now I must let go
I'll spend the rest of my life
So much left in it
Just let go

I Look and What Do I See,pop,Joe Raposo,92.0,"[ANN]
MOST TIMES IT’S ONLY THE SIMPLE EVERYDAY THINGS
LIKE RIBBON BOWS OR PUPPIES AND BOYS OR GAMES TO PLAY ON SWINGS
BUT SOMETIMES, HANGING UPSIDE DOWN FROM MARCELLA’S HAND
BY MYSELF I SEE A VERY SPECIAL LAND

I LOOK AND WHAT DO I SEE?
LOOKING OUT WITH TWO BRAND-NEW SHOEBUTTON EYES, HERE’S WHAT APPEARS TO ME:
I SEE LOTS OF PRETTY, AND A LOT OF HAPPY
AND A BIT OF EVERYTHING THAT’S THERE INSIDE OF ME!

I LOOK AND WHAT DO I SEE?
FROM A HEAD ALL FILLED WITH THREAD AND LINEN IN A RAGGY JAMBOREE
I SEE LOTS OF SMILING AND A LOT OF SINGING
AND A LOT OF SOMETHING ELSE THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN SEE!

LOTS OF BUTTERFLIES IN THE AIR
LOTS OF HONEYCOMB EVERYWHERE
ALL THE PRETTY THINGS WE COULD SHARE
TOGETHER!
I LOOK AND WHAT DO I SEE?

IT’S A FACE AS SMILING AND AS HOPEFUL AS MY OWN FACE HAS TO BE
SING SOMETHING PRETTY, ALL LIT UP AND SHINING
SING SOMETHING EVERYONE COULD BE IF THEY WERE ME
WHEN I LOOK, THAT’S WHAT I SEE!

On m'attend au studio, parait qu'ya un challenge là-bas
Parait qu'ya une petite qui dit Suzy Diamant jla bat
Bon elle est chiante en plus ce matin chuis pas d'humeur
J'vais voir son producteur qui pour m'avoir a joué l'allumeur
Moi c'est Suzy, j'rap et j'déchire
J'parle de uzy, de rap et d'désir
J'fais dans la provoc ouai, j'suis la future Missy
J'suis une meuf trop top ouai, une bombe et même un missile
Donc faut qu'je crame ma rivale dans l'tournoi
Faut que j'mette le paquet sinon la victoire, elle est pas pour moi
J'avoue c'est l'trou noir, si j'perds c'est la honte
Mais j'suis pas sournoise, car j'veux percer là-haut
Tu veux me cerner, j'rap mieux que toi et ta bande
Direct quand tu m'ecoutes, ferme-la cash, et abandonne
Donc Diam's diamant, j'vais lui mettre un perfect
Elle a à peine laché une phrase que déjà moi j'intercepte
Tu redis quoi d'ça, est-ce que tu contestes ?
C'est pas un hazard qu'on m'ai pris dans c'contexte
Moi c'est Suzyant, j'vais la rabaisser, l'humilier
Des vannes par milliers, j'vais la scier , j'vais la plier
Affiliée à aucun groupe, ni lascar ni tribu
Suzy liée au defaite que j'distribue
Moi c'est suzy, j'rap et j'déchire
J'parle de uzy, de rap et d'désir

Qu'est-ce qu'elles ont toutes à s'prouver Diamant
Parait qu'chuis rare, Diamant chuis dure a trouver
Parait qu'chuis dyslexique car parait qu'j'ai du lexique
Parait qu'quand j'dit lésique ya des filles qui s'disent sceptiques
Elle est tellement pas connue qu'j'savais même pas qu'elle existait
Faut pas qu'j'reparte toute nue, faut pas que j'la laisse résister
Mais bon malgré tout, Diamant, j'ai pas d'handicap
J'ai l'flow que cerne les demoiselle et que même les bandits captent
Logiquement j'devrais même pas rentrer dans l'jeu mais c'est plus fort que moi
J'devrais même pas car c'est dangereux, imagine qu'elle me sorte moi
Et puis j'm'en fou des polémiques, si la fille elle pose et nique
Moi j'm'en fou du kick moi je pose et file
Bon faut qu'je grouille j'vais être en retard, elle va croire que j'fuie
Même si elle sue j'ferais pas d'sentiments, elle verra qui j'suis, Diamant
Je suis la force, elle le légume
Et j'dé-dé-déguste la fille j'dé-dé-dégomme d'mon flow dès le dé-début

6 Foot 7 Foot Part II,rap,Gone_5zwt_009c,76.0,"[Hook:]
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch
(Yesss!)
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch
(Ahem)
[Verse 1:]
Excuse me for my newness
I still have influence
I'm like a batch of pennies minted this year--I'm a nuisance
Thumb on a navy ink pad--I got the blueprint
And yes, I'm bilingual--Pig Latin, I'm fluent
Don't look down on me cause I have no affluence
You see, I've got you fooled because you think that I am foolish
See, I am a hot rod with no engine coolant
And if I blow up, then I might cave the roof in
No, I'm not a typical rapper, so don't assume it
I pen lines with a dead eye, right on target like I'm shooting
That white rap, you know I'm that, it's real talk, no false teeth
You're all up on my back; I'm not a pony, so get off me!
Night owl, I'm wide awake while you all sleep
My flow is what you call sweet, and yours is what, salty?
Lost my mind last summer, yuh, it ran like a roadrunner, yuh
Running up the charts so I could never be a runner-up
My heart's afraid of me, so I won't ever have a heart attack
I mar this track; it's charred and black
Ha!
[Hook:]
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch
(Yeh!)
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch
(Hey, y'all, I'm back)
[Verse 2:]
My motives are like a swimsuit--they need no cover-up
Call me a stick in the mud, but I'm stirring up the dust
No joystick for this game; it's wired with no control
It's about time to change; I'm tired of going slow
I go
Hard in the paint, charging the lane, car in the lane, and I'm never parking, no brakes
Spit bars in a rage, no cards, I'm an ace, even though I'm young, I'm a star in the game
Tijuana - do you wanna cross the border, jump the fence?
I'm a new man coming with another man's beat, and I really don't care about the punishment
Yuh!
Can you tell that I do this with ease?
True spitter in the booth, a winner and the truth, I got it, now who is with me?
Even though I'm the king, you're not the court jester; quit fooling with me!
I ask JB a question: why can't there be beauty in beats?
Heyyy!
They love to hate, they hate to love, it's all opposites
I exited my body through my mouth; I'm so out of it
I'm on my Mary Poppins; I get to my spot and spit
Life's a battery; it needs both negatives and positives
Yeah
But most days I prefer neutrality
Duran Duran style, straddle the line in this duality
I wax poetic, carving lines into a candle
My flow divides the listeners like the English Channel
Read between the lines and down the line, images juxtaposed
I guess I do what the Bible says - I got love for foes
The ones who say I suck make me successful
Haters make me hate-proof, and skeptics make me special
It's my house, tell Avicii that I'm on another level
Taking time to understand this will not fit into your schedule
Enough time being slow, can I be a little rough? I eat this flow
In the middle of the muck, I see this home, and I got a lot of love for Regis flow
You know, cause everybody wants to be a millionaire
We want to throw ten thousand hundreds in the sky - million air
So most people would be looking to make a killing here
But I'm fixing to be giving you something filling here
Trees falling down behind me; I don't hear 'em
I yell, ""Swerve!"" and people swerve; I remote steer 'em
Stifle my creativity? Nuh-uh, you feed it
And no one's cut my legs off, so I guess I'm un-de-feet-ed
I've ripped my brakes out; there's no way that you can slow me
I've disconnected my cell so that you can't call me a phony
[Verse 3:]
Yeah, changing the voices, I've narrowed the choices down
I could either write invoices out or raise my voice and shout
Voice is loud, and it's also smooth; my lips are moistened now
I make music; it's more than just noise, you cow!
I know rap is going pop, I've heard of the merger
Let's have a hand for the true poets, yeah, word to the worders
You're like an edible balloon; I'll just burst you and serve you
And now I'm shooting for the kill, yes, I swerve for the murder
Get your typing fingers out; I got some words for your cursors
Only certain folks in charge; no one's herding the herders
Yeah, you losers, in the future, you can look back when I blew up
Ain't no replay for this big shot, quit rehashing the roofer
Soon I will be crowned king; I'll don my cap as a ruler
I'll run the race of life in bare feet and laugh at your Pumas
Yes
Run to the hills; my verbal gun, it will kill this beat and stun with a will
Kicking it like I punt for the Bills, and I'm pouring out all my love and my skill
Don't stunt for the bills, don't front for the silk, nah, I run for the thrill, never done with the skill
Expunging the ones that come from the mill, won't front as a shill, only love for the real
Six foot, seven foot, I only get taller
I squish a landline; the phonies get smaller
Although I live in reality, the rhyme is home
And this one was made by yours truly, Carolina's own!

I need security of people liking me
I can't be boring or else they will hate me

But I can't quite figure out how they could like me
For who I am
How pathetic is my life?
But don't feel sorry

I lie to have attention
I get it by pretending I have things I don't have
Like the cabbage patch kids that the girls have
This lie I've taken too far (wish I could take back)

But I can't quite figure out how they could like me
For who I am
How pathetic is my life?
But don't feel sorry for me!
Poor little me!
I lie and no one knows it
I'd like to be known as special
Don't judge me 'til I tell you what I did last night

Peace/War,rap,Shad,1435.0,"[Peace Intro: Shad]
Clever men and our violence
Silence is when we shoot from the lip to quiet them
We talk nonviolence and stay silent when it suits
It's all violence at the root
But tyrants aren't tyrants in group
Who started the shooting?
Who knows?
We were born inside of this troop
Taught to shoot as youth
Taught it's just humans being human
But the truth is...Shoot (get it? Get it?)
The truth is...
We don't know what the truth is...
(Get it, got it, good!)

[Peace Verse 1: Shad]
Yeah, yeah
One time for the people in my bloodline
A proud son of the people of the sunshine
My love letter to my people on the frontline
Yours truly, even if my pen was unsigned
Know it, the unnamed poet
My life is just a link in the chain and my chain glowin'
Me and the beat is thinkin' the same, she say ""go"" and
I just sprint in my lane, Usain, they can't slow him, oh

My whole team move at light speed
But so smooth, the whole movement Tai Chi
I said my whole team move at light speed
But we so smooth, the whole movement Tai Chi
We strike back with their force
They fight, we get more strength like Air Force
No Nikes, I mean no Air Force
More like peace
Soul, body, and psyche, yo

[Peace Verse2: Shad]
Now put this beat on for my people trying to keep on lights
And Nissans with the lease on tight
Black folk like Deshaun and Keyshaun
White folk get your dijon and your quiche on, like whoa
Listen, this is like a ""thank you"" you can dance to
Jam hot as a sand dune in Cancun
Show you how the fam moves, how a champ do
I can't lose when I'm kicking it, Man U
See they like me 'cause I ain't the type to lick a shot, still
If the shooter make me shoot it I can't miss the shot
Pistol cocked, more like missile launch, chill
And it piss 'em off how they can't piss him off
Killer cross

They see people duck, so they duck

It's too close to death
So I'll keep from fallin' asleep
I wanna keep it all
I keep a weapon on me
You can keep your calm
I've been weak and wrong
I've been ceap and a cheat, and deceitful, and evil
See I know life
""These bullets aren't real, wanna feel?""
I wanna be numb, gimme the numbers
I live in a slum, I want slumber
They only lift a thumb to keep us under
I know life, I know death
You never shot and stopped breath
See I know regrets, I know debts
You might be right but you know less
I know fights, I know stress
When you can't forget and clean the mess up
When it's fact, it's done
It's true than an uzi weighs a ton in the heat of the sun
Look, some wounds don't heal, you wanna feel?
You don't know the shame or the thrill
You don't know pain, you claim to be real
But you never killed and you never will
You can't know life without death
We know war, we know best
We know life in its sacredness
We know life 'cause we've taken it
And you can't own what you've never known
So I'll take yours, get shown what it's like
This death, this life, this fight is real

When you were young
Everyone said ""you're just like your father""
Didn't know your own strength
You've taken some blows
So you just hit harder
I was a girl who stood in the playground
Needed a friend to find a way out
I did what you said, I was easily led
But I got my karma

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me how come everybody says
""You should live with no regrets""
But everyone has done somethings, I bet they wanna forget

[Chorus]
And I was too young to know better
Too young to put it right
I know it ain't big, it ain't clever
So why did I play with fire?
We were out of control, ended up getting burnt
If only I'd known at the time
Too young to know better
And it's been forever
So can we draw a line?
[Verse 2]
When I was young
Everyone said I'm ""just like my mother""
Storm out the room or stay for the show
It's all part of the drama
We both said some things that we didn't mean
Feels like they're carved in stone in me
He knows what buttons to press
I should've left, if I was smarter

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
Yea
Look
Living life on the daily
Regular couldn't phase me
That shit made me realize I was stronger than eighty
Percent of the population, been maintaining
Myself as a person, yay high finger painting
Started chasing greatness back when the PlayStation
Had that memory card, best believe I was thinking
This world was so good and all the evil was vacant
Young lost and confused nigga, fuck was I thinking
Actually, I shouldn’t be hard on myself for breaking
Them simple rules, or pity a fool just for dreaming
Now I see life plain as day, and I'm awaken
Learnt don't put all your eggs in one basket because they breaking
And damn life is a lesson
And I ain’t ace the test yet, because I catch myself guessing Seeking approval from your peer group
Nigga stop stressing
Making it harder on yourself to deal with those imperfections
And God I got some questions
Don't mean to put you on blast, but you ignored my last message
Been tryna to talk to you dawg, since the age of eleven
Kept you deep in my thoughts, nah I ain't forgetting
Swear I bring that shit up whenever I'm reminiscing
I've seen our relationship slowly become distant
Don't know if you forgot me, or got me in vision
But hopefully your door is still open with no hinges
Hold on I'm trippin
You been with me from the start
How the fuck could I have ever think you left me in the dark
Listening to other people, I should've listened to my heart
But I ain’t even gonna lie
Trying to Cope is hard

Yea
Trying to Cope is hard
Tired of what you driving
Want you a new car
Tired of who you with
Wanna get you a star
Tired of taking shots
You trying to buy the bar
Damn
Trying to Cope is hard
Tired of no money
Got you breaking the law
Tired of fake friends
Got you playing the part
Remember who you are and how you made it this far (Look)

[Verse 2]
People ask me ""How you doing?""
I say surviving
Trying to love myself
But they say love is blinding
On some birdbox shit
Everyday I’m reminded
Them lights at the end of the tunnel just keep shining
But don't stare at it too long nigga, you’ll end up dying
Scared to fail at life
Impossible if you trying
Never putting work in
No wonder, you ain't finding
Yourself as a person
This stuff can be traumatizing
Trying to smoke just to cope with a couple things
Been through hell and back
Still dealing with pain
Still feeling some loss
Still stuck in a maze
Memories don't fade
I carry shit till this day
Never will I remain the same, or go steady
Got the city on my back
Won't drop it, that shit heavy
In fact
My pride is deadly ’cause I can't just push it to the side
And through my lowest points in life, I always see the highs
There's been some times where I feel like I lost hope
People take your kindness for weakness, but that's how you grow That's how you show society you won't fold
Survival of the fittest nigga
You know how it goes
Yea
Trying to Cope with my own life
Find my own path
My own light, hold on tight
Found my balance, now I'm beyond nice
Put two and two together and we gonna be ight

You follow for models to market your target
You running from scholars while teaching 'bout balance

And you serving a purpose away from a guest, deterring the craft
You have less of vision than drunken incisions

The Passion for Free Markets,misc,Noam Chomsky,55.0,"For more than half a century, the United Nations has been the main forum for the United States to try to create a world in its image, maneuvering with its allies to forge global accords about human rights, nuclear tests or the environment that Washington insisted would mirror its own values.""
So runs postwar history, we learn from the opening paragraph of a front-page story by New York Times political analyst David Sanger. But times are changing. Today, the headline reads: ""U.S. Is Exporting Its Free-Market Values Through Global Commercial Agreements."" Going beyond the traditional reliance on the UN, the Clinton administration is turning to the new World Trade Organization (WTO) to carry out the task of ""exporting American values."" Down the road, Sanger continues (quoting the U.S. trade representative), it is the WTO that may be the most effective instrument for bringing ""America’s passion for deregulation"" and for the free market generally, and ""the American values of free competition, fair rules, and effective enforcement,"" to a world still fumbling in darkness. These ""American values"" are illustrated most dramatically by the wave of the future: telecommunications, the Internet, advanced computer technology, and the other wonders created by the exuberant American entrepreneurial spirit unleashed by the market, at last freed from government interference by the Reagan revolution.

Today ""governments are everywhere embracing the free-market gospel preached in the 1980s by President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain,"" Youssef Ibrahim reports in another Times front-page story, reiterating a common theme. Like it or hate it, enthusiasts and critics over a broad range of opinion agree—just to keep to the liberal-to-left part of the spectrum—about ""the implacable sweep of what its exponents call ‘the market revolution’"": ""Reaganesque rugged individualism"" has changed the rules of the game worldwide, while here at home ""Republicans and Democrats alike are ready to give the market full sway"" in their dedication to ""the new orthodoxy.""

There are a number of problems with the picture. One is the account of the last half-century. Even the most dedicated believers in ""America’s mission"" must be aware that U.S./UN relations have been virtually the opposite of what the opening passage depicts ever since the UN fell out of control with the progress of decolonization, leaving the U.S. regularly isolated in opposition to global accords on a wide range of issues and committed to undermining central components of the UN, particularly those with a third world orientation. Many questions about the world are debatable, but surely not this one.

As for ""Reaganesque rugged individualism"" and its worship of the market, perhaps it is enough to quote the review of the Reagan years in Foreign Affairs by a Senior Fellow for International Finance at the Council on Foreign Relations, noting the ""irony"" that Ronald Reagan, ""the postwar chief executive with the most passionate love of laissez faire, presided over the greatest swing toward protectionism since the 1930s""—no ""irony,"" but the normal workings of ""passionate love of laissez faire"": for you, market discipline, but not for me, unless the ""playing field"" happens to be tilted in my favor, typically as a result of large-scale state intervention. It’s hard to find another theme so dominant in the economic history of the past three centuries. The current enthusiasms about the communications revolution that Sanger is reporting are a textbook case.

Reaganites were following a well-trodden course—recently turned into a comedy act by Gingrich ""conservatives""—when they extolled the glories of the market and issued stern lectures about the debilitating culture of dependency of the poor at home and abroad while boasting proudly to the business world that Reagan had ""granted more import relief to U.S. industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century""; in fact, more than all predecessors combined, as they led ""the sustained assault on [free trade] principle"" by the rich and powerful from the early 1970s, deplored in a scholarly review by GATT secretariat economist Patrick Low, who estimates the restrictive effects of Reaganite measures at about three times those of other leading industrial countries.

The radical ""swing toward protectionism"" was only a part of the ""sustained assault"" on free trade principles that was accelerated under ""Reaganite rugged individualism."" Another chapter of the story includes the huge transfer of public funds to private power, often under the traditional guise of ""security."" Without such extreme measures of market interference, it is doubtful that the U.S. automotive, steel, machine tool, semiconductor industries, and others, would have survived Japanese competition or been able to forge ahead in emerging technologies, with broad effects through the economy.

""Thatcher’s Britain"" is another good choice to illustrate ""free market gospel."" Just to keep to a few revelations of early 1997, ""during the period of maximum pressure to make arms sales to Turkey,"" the London Observer reported, Prime Minister Thatcher ""personally intervened to ensure a payment of 22 million pounds was made out of Britain’s overseas aid budget, to help build a metro in the Turkish capital of Ankara. The project was uneconomical, and in 1995 it was admitted"" by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd that it was ""unlawful."" The incident was particularly noteworthy in the aftermath of the Pergau Dam scandal, which revealed illegal Thatcherite subsidies ""to ‘sweeten’ arms deals with the Malaysian regime,"" with a High Court judgment against Hurd. That’s aside from government credit guarantees and financing arrangements, and the rest of the panoply of devices to transfer public funds to ""defense industry,"" yielding a familiar range of benefits to advanced industry generally.

A few days before, the same journal reported that ""up to 2 million British children are suffering ill-health and stunted growth because of malnutrition"" as a result of ""poverty on a scale not seen since the 1930s."" The trend to increasing child health has reversed and childhood diseases that had been controlled are now on the upswing thanks to the (highly selective) ""free market gospel"" that is much admired by the beneficiaries.

A few months earlier, a lead headline reported ""One in three British babies born in poverty,"" as ""child poverty has increased as much as three-fold since Margaret Thatcher was elected."" ""Dickensian diseases return to haunt today’s Britain,"" another headline reads, reporting studies concluding that ""social conditions in Britain are returning to those of a century ago."" Particularly grim are the effects of cutting off gas, electricity, water, and telephones to ""a high number of households"" as privatization takes its natural course, with a variety of devices that favor ""more affluent customers"" and amount to a ""surcharge on the poor,"" leading to a ""growing gulf in energy between rich and poor,"" also in water supply and other services. The ""savage cuts"" in social programs are placing the nation ""in the grip of panic about imminent social collapse."" But industry and finance are benefiting very nicely from the same policy choices. To top it all off, public spending after 17 years of Thatcherite gospel was the same 42 1/4 percent of GDP that it was when she took over.

Not exactly unfamiliar here.
Exporting American Values

Let us put aside the intriguing contrast between doctrine and reality, and see what can be learned by examining the new era that is coming into view. Quite a lot, I think.

Sanger is celebrating the WTO agreement on telecommunications. One of its welcome effects is to provide Washington with a ""new tool of foreign policy."" The agreement ""empowers the WTO to go inside the borders of the 70 countries that have signed it,"" and it is no secret that international institutions can function insofar as they keep to the demands of the powerful, in particular, the United States. In the real world, then, the ""new tool"" allows the U.S. to intervene profoundly in the internal affairs of others, compelling them to change their laws and practices. Crucially, the WTO will make sure that other countries are ""following through on their commitments to allow foreigners to invest"" without restriction in central areas of their economy. In the specific case at hand, the likely outcome is clear to all: ""The obvious corporate beneficiaries of this new era will be U.S. carriers, who are best positioned to dominate a level playing field,"" the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER) points out, along with one UK-U.S. megacorporation.

Not everyone is delighted by the prospects. The winners recognize that fact, and offer their interpretation: in Sanger’s words, others fear that ""American telecommunication giants...could overwhelm the flabby government-sanctioned monopolies that have long dominated telecommunications in Europe and Asia""—as in the United States, long past the period when it had become by far the world’s leading economy and most powerful state. It is also worth noting that major contributions to modern technology came from the research laboratories of the ""flabby government-sanctioned monopoly"" that dominated telecommunications here until the 1970s, using its freedom from market discipline to provide for the needs of advanced sectors of industry generally by transfer of public funds (in indirect ways, unlike the more direct modalities of the Pentagon system).

Those who cling irrationally to the past see matters a bit differently. The FEER points out that ""jobs will be lost"" in Asia and ""many Asian consumers will have to pay more for phone service before they will pay less."" When will they pay less? For that bright future to dawn, it is only necessary for foreign investors to be ""encouraged...to act in socially desired ways,"" not simply with an eye to profit and service to the rich and the business world. How this miracle will come to pass is unexplained, though doubtless the suggestion will inspire serious reflection in corporate headquarters.

In the time span relevant to planning, the WTO agreement will raise phone service costs for most Asian consumers, the Review predicts. ""The fact is, comparatively few customers in Asia stand to benefit from cheaper overseas rates"" that are anticipated with the takeover by huge foreign corporations, mostly American. In Indonesia, for example, only about 300,000 of 190 million people make overseas calls at all, specifically the business sector. ""It’s very likely the cost of local telecoms service, in general, will rise"" in Asia, according to David Barden, regional telecoms analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities in Hong Kong. But that is all to the good, he continues: ""if there is no profitability in the business, there will be no business."" And now that still more public property is being handed over to foreign corporations, they had better be guaranteed profitability — telecommunications today, and a far wider range of related services tomorrow. The business press predicts that ""personal communications over the Internet [including corporate networks and interactions] will overtake telecommunications in five or six years, and telephone operators have the biggest interest in getting into the online business."" Contemplating the future of his own company, Intel CEO Andrew Grove sees the Internet as ""the biggest change in our environment"" at present. He expects large-scale growth for ""the connection providers, the people involved in generating the World Wide Web, the people who make the computers"" (""people"" meaning corporations), and the advertising industry, already running at almost $350 billion annually and anticipating new opportunities with the privatization of the Internet, which is expected to convert it to a global oligopoly.

Meanwhile privatization precedes apace elsewhere. To take one important case, over considerable popular opposition the government of Brazil has decided to privatize the Vale Company, which controls vast uranium, iron, and other mineral resources and industrial and transport facilities, including sophisticated technology. Vale is highly profitable, with a 1996 income of over $5 billion, and excellent prospects for the future; it is 1 of 6 Latin American enterprises ranked among the 500 most profitable in the world. A study by specialists of the Graduate School of Engineering at the Federal University in Rio estimated that the government has seriously undervalued the Company, noting also that it relied on an ""independent"" analysis by Merrill Lynch, which happens to be associated with the Anglo American conglomerate that is seeking to take over this central component of Brazil’s economy. The government angrily denies the conclusions. If they are accurate, as one may plausibly surmise, it will fall into a very familiar pattern.

Side comment: Communications are not quite the same as uranium. Where there is even a pretense of democracy, communications are at its heart. Concentration of communications in any hands (particularly foreign hands) raises some rather serious questions about meaningful democracy. Similar questions arise about concentration of finance, which undermines popular involvement in social and economic planning. Control over food raises even more serious questions, in this case about survival. A year ago the secretary-general of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, discussing the ""food crisis following huge rises in cereals prices this year,"" warned that countries ""must become more self reliant in food production,"" the London Financial Times reported. The FAO is warning ""developing countries"" to reverse the policies imposed on them by the ""Washington Consensus,"" policies that have had a disastrous impact on much of the world, while proving a great boon to subsidized agribusiness—incidentally, also to narcotrafficking, perhaps the most dramatic success of neoliberal reforms as judged by the ""free market values"" that the ""U.S. is exporting.""

Control over food supplies by foreign corporate giants is well under way, and with the agreement on telecommunications signed and delivered, financial services are next in line.

Summarizing, the expected consequences of the victory for ""American values"" at the WTO are: (1) a ""new tool"" for far-reaching U.S. intervention into the internal affairs of others; (2) the takeover of a crucial sector of foreign economies by U.S.-based corporations; (3) benefits for business sectors and the wealthy; (4) shifting of costs to the general population; (5) new and potentially powerful weapons against the threat of democracy.

A rational person might ask whether these expectations have something to do with the celebration, or whether they are just incidental to a victory of principle that is celebrated out of commitment to higher values. Skepticism is heightened by comparison of the Times’ picture of the postwar era with uncontested fact. It is further enhanced by a look at some of history’s striking regularities, among them, that those in a position to impose their projects not only hail them with enthusiasm but also typically benefit from them, whether the values professed involve free trade or other grand principles—which turn out in practice to be finely tuned to the needs of those running the game and cheering the outcome. Logic alone would suggest a touch of skepticism when the pattern is repeated. History should raise it a notch higher.

In fact, we need not even search that far.

An Improper Forum
The same day that the front page was reporting the victory for American values at the World Trade Organization, New York Times editors warned the European Union not to turn to the WTO to rule on its charge that the U.S. is violating free trade agreements. Narrowly at issue is the Helms-Burton Act, which ""compels the United States to impose sanctions against foreign companies that do business in Cuba."" The sanctions ""would effectively exclude these firms from exporting to, or doing business in, the United States, even if their products and activities have nothing to do with Cuba"" (Peter Morici, former director of economics at the U.S. International Trade Commission). That is no slight penalty, even apart from more direct threats against individuals and companies who cross a line that Washington will draw unilaterally. The editors regard the Act as a ""misguided attempt by Congress to impose its foreign policy on others""; Morici opposes it because it ""is creating more costs than benefits"" for the U.S. More broadly at issue is the embargo itself, ""the American economic strangulation of Cuba"" that the editors term ""a cold war anachronism,"" best abandoned because it is becoming harmful to U.S. business interests.

But broader questions of right and wrong do not arise, and the whole affair is ""essentially a political dispute,"" the Times editors stress, not touching on Washington’s ""free-trade obligations."" Like most others, the editors apparently assume that if Europe persists, the WTO is likely to rule against the United States. Accordingly, the WTO is not a proper forum.

The logic is simple, and standard. Ten years ago, on the same grounds, the International Court of Justice was found to be an inappropriate forum for judging Nicaragua’s charges against Washington. The U.S. rejected ICJ jurisdiction, and when the Court condemned the U.S. for the ""unlawful use of force,"" ordering Washington to cease its international terrorism, violation of treaties, and illegal economic warfare, and to pay substantial reparations, the Democrat-controlled Congress reacted by instantly escalating the crimes while the Court was roundly denounced on all sides as a ""hostile forum"" that had discredited itself by rendering a decision against the United States. The Court judgment itself was scarcely reported, including the words just quoted and the explicit ruling that U.S. aid to the contras is ""military"" and not ""humanitarian."" Along with U.S. direction of the terrorist forces, the aid continued until the U.S. imposed its will, always called ""humanitarian aid."" Public history keeps to the same conventions.

The U.S. then vetoed a Security Council resolution calling on all states to observe international law (scarcely reported), and voted alone (with El Salvador and Israel) against a General Assembly Resolution calling for ""full and immediate compliance"" with the Court’s ruling—unreported in the mainstream, as was the repetition the following year, this time with only Israel on board. The whole affair happens to be a typical illustration of how the U.S. used the UN as a ""forum"" for imposing ""its own values.""

Returning to the current WTO case, in November 1996, Washington voted alone (with Israel and Uzbekistan) against a General Assembly Resolution, backed by the entire European Union, urging the U.S. to drop the embargo against Cuba. The Organization of American States had already voted unanimously to reject the Helms-Burton Act, and had asked its judicial body (the Inter-American Juridical Committee) to rule on its legality. In August 1996, the IAJC ruled unanimously that the Act violated international law. A year earlier, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the OAS had condemned the U.S. restrictions on shipments of food and medicine to Cuba as a violation of international law. The Clinton administration’s response was that shipments of medicine are not literally barred, only prevented by conditions so onerous and threatening that even the largest corporations here and abroad are unwilling to face the prospects (huge financial penalties and imprisonment for what Washington determines to be violations of ""proper distribution,"" banning of ships and aircraft, mobilization of media campaigns, etc.). And while food shipments are indeed barred, the Administration argues that there are ""ample suppliers"" elsewhere (at far higher cost), so that the direct violation of international law is not a violation.

As the issue was brought by the EU to the World Trade Organization, the U.S. withdrew from the proceedings on the ICJ model, effectively bringing the matter to a close.

In short, the world that the U.S. has sought ""to create in its image"" through international institutions is one based on the principle of the rule of force. The ""American passion for free trade"" entails that the U.S. government may violate trade agreements at will. No problem arises when communications, finance, and food supplies are taken over by foreign (mainly U.S.) corporations. Matters are different, however, when trade agreements and international law interfere with the projects of the powerful.

We learn more by investigating the reasons for U.S. rejection of international law and trade agreements. In the Nicaragua case, State Department Legal Adviser Abraham Sofaer explained that when the U.S. accepted World Court jurisdiction in the 1940s, most members of the UN ""were aligned with the United States and shared its views regarding world order."" But now ""A great many of these cannot be counted on to share our view of the original constitutional conception of the UN Charter,"" and ""This same majority often opposes the United States on important international questions."" It is therefore understandable that the U.S. should be far in the lead since the 1960s in vetoing UN resolutions on a wide range of issues including international law, human rights, environmental protection, and so on (UK second, France a distant third), precisely contrary to the standard version repeated in the opening paragraph above. The U.S. advanced its lead another notch shortly after this account appeared, casting its 71st veto since 1967. When the question (Israeli settlements in Jerusalem) moved to the General Assembly, the U.S. and Israel stood alone in opposition, again a standard pattern.

Drawing the natural conclusions from the unreliability of the world, Sofaer went on to explain that we must now ""reserve to ourselves the power to determine whether the Court has jurisdiction over us in a particular case."" The long-standing principle, now to be enforced in a world that is no longer obedient, is that ""the United States does not accept compulsory jurisdiction over any dispute involving matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States, as determined by the United States."" The ""domestic matters"" in question were the U.S. attack against Nicaragua.

The basic operative principle was stated elegantly by the new Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, when she lectured the UN Security Council about its unwillingness to go along with U.S. demands concerning Iraq: The U.S. will ""behave, with others, multilaterally when we can and unilaterally as we must,"" recognizing no external constraints in an area deemed ""vital to U.S. national interests""—as determined by the United States. The UN is an appropriate forum when its members ""can be counted on"" to share Washington’s views, but not when the majority ""opposes the United States on important international questions."" International law and democracy are fine things—but as judged by outcome, not process; like free trade.

The current U.S. stand in the WTO case thus breaks no new ground. Washington declared that the WTO ""has no competence to proceed"" on an issue of American national security; we are to understand that our existence is at stake in the strangulation of the Cuban economy. A WTO ruling against the U.S. in absentia would be of no significance or concern, a Clinton administration spokesperson added, because ""we do not believe anything the WTO says or does can force the U.S. to change its laws."" Recall that the great merit of the WTO telecommunications agreement was that this ""new tool of foreign policy"" forces other countries to change their laws and practices, in accord with our demands.

The principle is that the U.S. is exempt from WTO interference with its laws, just as it is free to violate international law at will; uniquely, though the privilege may be extended to client states as circumstances require. The fundamental principles of world order again resound, loud and clear.

The earlier GATT agreements had allowed for national security exceptions, and under them, Washingon had justified its embargo against Cuba as ""measures taken in pursuit of essential US security interests."" The WTO agreement also permits a member to take ""any action it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests,"" but only in relation to three designated issues: fissionable materials, traffic in armaments, and actions ""taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations."" Perhaps not wishing to be officially on record with an utter absurdity, the Clinton administration did not formally invoke its ""national security exemption,"" though it did make clear that the issue was ""national security.""
At the time of writing, the EU and the U.S. are trying to arrange a deal before April 14, when the WTO hearings are scheduled to begin. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports, Washington ""says it won’t cooperate with the WTO panels, arguing that the trade organization doesn’t have jurisdiction over national security issues.""

Indecent Thoughts

Polite people are not supposed to remember the reaction when Kennedy tried to organize collective action against Cuba in 1961: Mexico could not go along, a diplomat explained, because ""If we publicly declare that Cuba is a threat to our security, forty million Mexicans will die laughing."" Here we take a more sober view of threats to the national security.

There were also no reported deaths from laughter when Administration spokesperson Stuart Eizenstat, justifying Washington’s rejection of the WTO agreements, ""argued that Europe is challenging ‘three decades of American Cuba policy that goes back to the Kennedy Administration,’ and is aimed entirely at forcing a change of government in Havana"" (NYT). A sober reaction is entirely in order on the assumption that the U.S. has every right to overthrow another government; in this case, by aggression, large-scale terror, and economic strangulation.

The assumption remains in place and apparently unchallenged, but Eizenstat’s statement was criticized on narrower grounds by historian Arthur Schlesinger. Writing ""as one involved in the Kennedy Administration’s Cuban policy,"" Schlesinger pointed out that Under Secretary of Commerce Eizenstat had misunderstood the policies of the Kennedy administration. Its concern was Cuba’s ""troublemaking in the hemisphere"" and ""the Soviet connection."" But these are now behind us, so the Clinton policies are an anachronism, though otherwise, it seems, unobjectionable.

Schlesinger did not explain the meaning of the phrases ""troublemaking in the hemisphere"" and ""the Soviet connection,"" but he has elsewhere, in secret. Reporting to the incoming President on the conclusions of a Latin American Mission in early 1961, Schlesinger spelled out the problem of Castro’s ""troublemaking"": it is ""the spread of the Castro idea of taking matters into one’s own hands,"" a serious problem, he added shortly after, when ""The distribution of land and other forms of national wealth greatly favors the propertied classes...[and] The poor and underprivileged, stimulated by the example of the Cuban revolution, are now demanding opportunities for a decent living."" Schlesinger also explained the threat of the ""Soviet connection"": ""Meanwhile, the Soviet Union hovers in the wings, flourishing large development loans and presenting itself as the model for achieving modernization in a single generation."" The ""Soviet connection"" was perceived in a similar light far more broadly in Washington and London, from the origins of the Cold War in 1917 into the 1960s, when the documentary record currently ends.

Schlesinger also recommended to the incoming president ""a certain amount of high-flown corn"" about ""the higher aims of culture and spirit,"" which ""will thrill the audience south of the border, where metahistorical disquisitions are inordinately admired."" Meanwhile we’ll take care of serious matters. Just to show how much things change, Schlesinger also realistically criticized ""the baleful influence of the International Monetary Fund,"" then pursuing the 1950’s version of today’s ""Washington Consensus"" (""structural adjustment,"" ""neoliberalism"").

With these (secret) explanations of Castro’s ""troublemaking in the hemisphere"" and the ""Soviet connection,"" we come a step closer to an understanding of the reality of the Cold War. But that is another topic.

Similar troublemaking beyond the hemisphere has also been no slight problem, and continues to spread dangerous ideas among people who ""are now demanding opportunities for a decent living."" In late February 1996, while the U.S. was in an uproar over Cuba’s downing of two planes of a Florida-based anti-Castro group that had regularly penetrated Cuban airspace, dropping leaflets in Havana calling on Cubans to revolt (also participating in the continuing terrorist attacks against Cuba, according to Cuban sources), the wire services were running different stories. AP reported that in South Africa, ""a cheering, singing crowd welcomed Cuban doctors"" who had just arrived at the invitation of the Mandela government ""to boost medical care in poor rural areas."" ""Cuba has 57,000 doctors for its 11 million people, compared to 25,000 in South Africa for 40 million people."" The 101 Cuban doctors included top medical specialists who, if they were South African, would ""very likely be working in Cape Town or Johannesburg"" at twice the salaries they will receive in the poor rural areas where they go. ""Since the program of sending public health specialists overseas began in Algeria in 1963, Cuba has sent 51,820 doctors, dentists, nurses and other medical doctors"" to ""the poorest Third World nations,"" providing ""medical aid totally free of charge"" in most cases. A month later Cuban medical experts were invited by Haiti to study a meningitis outbreak.

This kind of troublemaking goes back a long way. A leading West German journal (Die Zeit) reported that Third World countries regard Cuba as ""an international superpower"" because of the teachers, construction workers, physicians, and others involved in ""international service."" In 1985, it reported, 16,000 Cubans worked in Third World countries, more than twice the total of Peace Corps and AID specialists from the United States. By 1988, Cuba had ""more physicians working abroad than any industrialized nation, and more than the UN’s World Health Organization."" Most of this aid is uncompensated, and Cuba’s ""international emissaries"" are ""men and women who live under conditions that most development aid workers would not accept,"" which is ""the basis for their success."" For Cubans, the report continues, ""international service"" is regarded as ""a sign of political maturity"" and taught in the schools as ""the highest virtue."" The warm reception by an ANC delegation in South Africa in 1996, and the crowds singing ""long live Cuba,"" attest to the same phenomenon.

On the side, we might ask how the U.S. would react to Libyan planes flying over New York and Washington dropping leaflets calling on Americans to revolt, after years of terrorist attacks against U.S. targets at home and abroad. By garlanding them with flowers, perhaps? A hint was given by Barrie Dunsmore of ABC a few weeks before the downing of the two planes, citing Walter Porges, former ""ABC News"" vice president for News Practices. Porges reports that when an ABC news crew on a civilian plane attempted to take photographs of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, ""it was told to move immediately or it would be shot down,"" which ""would have been legal under provisions of International Law defining military air space."" A small country under attack by a superpower is a different matter, however.

A further look at history may be useful. The policy of overthrowing the government of Cuba does not go back to the Kennedy administration, as Eizenstat asserted, but to its predecessor: the formal decision to overthrow Castro in favor of a regime ""more devoted to the true interests of the Cuban people and more acceptable to the U.S."" was taken in secret in March 1960, with the addendum that the operation must be carried out ""in such a manner as to avoid any appearance of U.S. intervention,"" because of the expected reaction in Latin America and the need to ease the burden on doctrinal managers at home. At the time, the ""Soviet connection"" and ""troublemaking in the hemisphere"" were nil, apart from the Schlesingerian version.

Since Washington is the arbiter of the ""true interests of the Cuban people,"" it was unnecessary for the Eisenhower administration to attend to the public opinion studies it received, reporting popular support for Castro and optimism about the future. For similar reasons, current information about these matters is of no account. The Clinton Administration is serving the true interests of the Cuban people by imposing misery and starvation, whatever studies of Cuban opinion may indicate: for example, the polls reported in December 1994 by an affiliate of the Gallup organization that found that half the population consider the embargo to be the ""principal cause of Cuba’s problems"" while 3 percent found the ""political situation"" to be the ""most serious problem facing Cuba today""; that 77 percent regard the USA as Cuba’s ""worst friend"" (no one else reached 3 percent); that by 2 to 1, the population feel that the revolution has registered more achievements than failures, the ""principal failure"" being ""having depended on socialist countries like Russia which betrayed us""; and that half describe themselves as ""revolutionary,"" another 20 percent ""communist"" or ""socialist.""

Right or wrong, the conclusions about public attitudes are irrelevant, again a regular pattern, at home as well.

History buffs might recall that the policy actually dates back to the 1820s, when Washington’s intention to take control of Cuba was blocked by the British deterrent. Cuba was regarded by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams as ""an object of transcendent importance to the commercial and political interests of our Union,"" but he advised patience: over time, he predicted, Cuba would fall into U.S. hands by ""the laws of political...gravitation,"" a ""ripe fruit"" for harvest. So it did, as power relations shifted enough for the U.S. to liberate the island (from its people) at the end of the century, turning it into a U.S. plantation and haven for crime syndicates and tourists.

The historical depth of the commitment to rule Cuba may help account for the element of hysteria so apparent in the execution of the enterprise; for example, the ""almost savage"" atmosphere of the first cabinet meeting after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion described by Chester Bowles, the ""almost frantic reaction for an action program,"" a mood reflected in President Kennedy’s public statements about how failure to act would leave us ""about to be swept away with the debris of history."" Clinton’s initiatives, public and indirect, reveal a similar streak of vindictive fanaticism, as in the threats and prosecutions that ensured that ""the number of companies granted U.S. licences to sell [medicines] to Cuba has fallen to less than 4 percent"" of the levels prior to the Cuban Democracy Act (CDA) of October 1992, while ""only a few of the world’s medical companies have attempted to brave U.S. regulations"" and penalties, a review in Britain’s leading medical journal reports.

Considerations such as these carry us from the abstract plane of international law and solemn agreements to the realities of human life. Lawyers may debate whether the ban on food and (effectively) medicine violates international agreements stating that ""food must not be used as an instrument for political and economic pressure"" (Rome Declaration, 1996) and other declared principles and commitments. But the victims have to live with the fact that the CDA has ""resulted in a serious reduction in the trade of legitimate medical supplies and food donations, to the detriment of the Cuban people"" (Joanna Cameron, Fletcher Forum). A recently released study of the American Association for World Health concludes that the embargo has caused serious nutritional deficits, deterioration in the supply of safe drinking water, and sharp decline in availability of medicines and medical information, leading to low birth-rate, epidemics of neurological and other diseases with tens of thousands of victims, and other severe health consequences. ""Health and nutrition standards have been devastated by the recent tightening of the 37-year-old US embargo, which includes food imports,"" Victoria Brittain writes in the British press, reporting the year-long study by U.S. specialists, which found ""hospitalised children lying in agony as essential drugs are denied them"" and doctors compelled ""to work with medical equipment at less than half efficiency because they have no spare parts."" Similar conclusions are drawn in other current studies in professional journals.

These are the real crimes, far more than the casual and reflexive violation of legal instruments that are used as weapons against official enemies, with the cynicism that only the truly powerful can display.

In fairness, it should be added that the suffering caused by the embargo is sometimes reported here as well. A lead story in the New York Times business section is headlined: ""Exploding Cuban Cigar Prices: Now Embargo Really Hurts as Big Smokes Grow Scarcer."" The story reports the tribulations of business executives at ""a plush smoking room"" in Manhattan, who lament ""that it’s really tough to get a Cuban cigar in the States these days"" except at ""prices that catch in the throats of the most devoted smokers.""

While the Clinton administration, exploiting the privilege of the powerful, attributes the grim consequences of economic warfare without parallel in current history to the policies of the regime from which it promises to ""liberate"" the suffering Cuban people, a more plausible conclusion is more nearly the reverse: the ""American economic strangulation of Cuba"" has been designed, maintained, and in the post-Cold War era intensified, for the reasons implicit in Arthur Schlesinger’s report to incoming President Kennedy. Much as Kennedy’s Latin American Mission feared, the successes of programs to improve health and living standards had been helping to spread ""the Castro idea of taking matters into one’s own hands,"" stimulating ""the poor and underprivileged"" in the region with the worst inequality in the world to ""demand opportunities for a decent living,"" and with dangerous effects beyond as well. There is a substantial and compelling documentary record, accompanied by consistent action based on quite rational motives, which lends no slight credibility to this assessment. To evaluate the claim that the policies flow from concern for human rights and democracy, the briefest look at the record is more than sufficient, at least for those who even pretend to be serious.

It is improper, however, to have any thoughts or recollections about such matters as we celebrate the triumph of ""American values."" Nor are we supposed to remember that a few months ago, inspired by the same passion for free trade, Clinton ""pressured Mexico into an agreement that will end the shipment of low-price tomatoes to the United States,"" a gift to Florida growers that costs Mexico about $800 million annually, and that violates NAFTA as well as the WTO agreements (though only ""in spirit,"" because it was a sheer power play and did not require an official tariff). The Administration explained the decision forthrightly: Mexican tomatoes are cheaper and consumers here prefer them. The free market is working, but with the wrong outcome. Or perhaps tomatoes too are a threat to national security.

To be sure, tomatoes and telecommunications are in very different leagues. Any favors Clinton might owe to Florida growers are dwarfed by the requirements of the telecommunications industry, even apart from what Thomas Ferguson describes as ""the best-kept secret of the 1996 election"": that ""more than any other single bloc, it was the telecommunications sector that rescued Bill Clinton,"" who received major campaign contributions from ""this staggeringly profitable sector."" The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the WTO agreement are, in a sense, ""thank you"" notes, though it is unlikely that the outcome would have been very different if a different mix of largesse had been chosen by the business world, suffering at the time from what Business Week had just called ""spectacular"" profits in yet another ""Surprise Party for Corporate America.""

Prominent among the truths that are not to be recalled are the ones briefly mentioned earlier: the actual record of ""Reaganesque rugged individualism"" and the ""free market gospel"" that was preached (to the poor and defenseless) while protectionism reached unprecedented heights and the Administration poured public funds into high tech industry with unusual abandon. Here we begin to reach the heart of the matter. The reasons for skepticism about the ""passion"" that have just been reviewed are valid enough, but they are a footnote to the real story: how U.S. corporations came to be so well-placed to take over international markets, inspiring the current celebration of ""American values.""

But that, again, is a larger tale, one that tells us a lot about the contemporary world: its social and economic realities, and the grip of ideology and doctrine, including those doctrines crafted to induce hopelessness, resignation, and despair.",0.39614967674468504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I open my mouth, they don't speak such
I rap hardcore like porn-clip bitches
Asses so big, they need a fork-lift, bitches
It's me myself and I working at irregular
Push up 69s, I'm doing that on regular
And my hoe in a hotel or lights on in a motel
Fuck her all night long tie her mouth so she won't tell
Sweet melody came out right from my dream
We still don't give a fuck, gonna roll another track
We gotta break free but not like Freddy Mercury
He was fucking guys in the ass and died of HIV
He's a queen I'm the preacher, you're a school girl I'm a teacher
Gotta spank that ass before the class! Uh, uh, before the class
If she don't have any titties then she gots to bare some ass
If the bitch ain't dirty she gots to have some class

She was wriggling on the bed while her body took a spasm
Eyes on the prize and my lips on her nipples
Tommy Cash you crazy fuck — he makes it look so simple
I take her from behind, now I hit that shit doggy
She's squirting like a little dolphin, now it’s time to blow me
Sheets are going to flop, she's screaming like a whore
Baby wanna move a lot ‘cause she be watching that porn
Getting so juicy flows all through her pussy

Lick that pussy on rotation — it's a triple H flow and this is my session

Tão bom te assistir sorrir

(Tão bom)

[Verso 1: niLL]
É uma pena que o mundo tá acabando
E eu te conheci (Por que?)
Veja só como as pessoas daqui
Eles gostam de mim
Ainda nos viram juntos
Provavelmente vai gerar assunto
E, só quero o melhor
Por que eu sou um cara justo
Que tal dormir na sua casa
Quase meia noite
E a gente fuma muito na sala, em paz
Os dias têm sido bons demais
Pelo visto convidados especiais
Eu sei bem o que vem depois disso
Sempre pronto pra correr o risco (Depois?)
Cê tá cansada então troca de disco (E eu?)
Ficou sozinha então conta comigo (É isso)
Gosta de tudo menos fotos e vídeos
E ainda me disse que eu fazia o tipo

Tão bom te assistir sorrir
Tão bom te assistir sorrir

[Verso 2: Choice]
Chega na sala, sabe que vou laçá-la
Lançá-la na sala na cama
E queimá-la
Pra depois apagá-la
Entre palavras, beijos
Brigas e bagas
Entre cortejos e promessas
Bregas e fagas
Ela joga sujo
Me suga e me traga
Se cega com a fumaça
Ela fuma vários da braba
Alega que me segue
Atrás do sossego
E quando eu me sinto cansado
É só o começo da saga
Por pior que seja
Ela me acorda cedo
Me pede uma seda
E eu cedo
Aperta mais um cigarro
Entre semente e galhos
Entorpecentes no carro
Acelerando na estrada
Não ligamos pra nada, linda
Me xinga e chora
Toda vez que me atraso
Me hipnotiza os movimentos iguais
Eu vejo tudo em nossa troca de olhar
Até na troca de tiro
Nós combinamos e tal

AutobiHography,rap,Sevin,283.0,"Every single day I wake I pray
That it won't be the day I stray away
Ay
Forgive me for what I've done
Let me know I'm still your son
Right here right now

[Verse: Sevin]
C'mon
Let me bring the truth to the speculations
While ya'll question my reputation
Long before the rap game
To the grave I made my reservations
I was just a lonely child
Parents always told me smile
Had to survive as well as comply
What they holdin' now
Grew up on the front pew
Never really took heed
So much hypocrisy the block and me
Bound in debauchery
Often we'd
Sneak out of Sunday school
Stealing candy from the corner store
Thinkin' it was someway cool
Graduated with a BA from gunplay school
Smokin' on the freeway
Mid 90s reality strikes and hits harder
Lost my only brother dog
The memory gets farther
5 niggas dippin' down a windy mountain highway
Lost control
My bro was the only one that lost his soul
He died brutally
We later found out that the same dude who read his eulogy
Robbed his corpse of his jewelry
Needless to say well that dude ain't last long
I ain't one for gossip so...
We'll just say he passed on
Smoked my first cigarette the day my nigga went
And since he left my chest
Had to pay the rest
Then we lost 'Pac
I never met him face to face
But the pain in the art is what connected us
Haste to haste
BIG died, Pun died
My cut's son died
6 shots breath slipped away
Though his lungs tried
Robbin niggas set him up
For a dice game they wet him up
Northside esse's for awhile I was prejudice
I was with him all day
In that hallway
Bone to my zone got home phone ringin' as they call me
Hysterically explainin' and
Less than layman's
How they came in and slayed him
Put the shells in the guage and smashed to the north
Somebody pass me a 'port
That niggas dying on blood
Smash the remorse
The streets is so ill
The zone is so real
Before he could leave and throw em still
He got his dome peeled
I was never satisfied I felt he died mercifully
I wished to God I was the one that wet his shirt personally
I can never bring my kin back home
No matter how many shells I had put in that dome
Cuz death is final
So I put my breath on the vinyl
History repeats itself my section is primal
Uh
I used to sell sacks in the back of the glass
With a backpack strap and a mask
Olympic speed when I dash from the cab to Broadway
Residential yards
Where we practiced the blast
Almost wish I never learned half the things I picked up
But I had to adapt to the pack or get clipped up
I remember my homie told me
""I ain't trying to sock a thing
Unless Don King is promoting me in the boxing ring""
And then shot this racist in the face
And by the end of his case his whole life was a waste
Gone
I got a homeboy doing 33 for robbin' banks
That's Scottie Pippen time
It started off, but dog I'm getting mine
Now he's getting nothing else but his commissary
He'll never get to see the child that his baby mama carried
We close our eyes just enough to sleep
Seems we only get to hustle just enough to eat
Cuz One Time's just up the street
Time is money so there ain't no such things as
""Just a week""
It wasn't until they arrested me that I'd meditate heavily
And the ways that He was blessin' me set me free
I've been popped at 8 times
Train stations, house parties
Driver side windows, dang they ain't take you out hardly
God's hand guarded me
Even from my own hate
2 attempted suicides
And just between you and I
Liquid Drain-O to the neck
And yet it did not effect
Pistol to my tonsil ""click""
The bullet did not eject
6 car accidents
2 dead passengers
Thyroid, Stab wounds
Normal ghetto massacres
My life's more kosher than most of the homies
But repulsive conditions just kept me
Close to homie
Rats in this maze crazed
Still seekin' better days
He who hath breath let him praise
Or be too set in ways
So I'm glad that I broke free
Cuz so many approach me
With them wicked hopes to smoke me
Folks took it like a joke when I spoke that I changed
And
I don't blame em
I was the same one yesterday
Throwin' up where I came from
L Block gang hun
So broke 4 niggas shared the same gun
I will never profess to be the hardest on the set to G
But believe when they tested me
They walked away respecting me
C'mon
Been jumped
Been jacked
And I've been marked for death
Dumped and scrapped
And had to get scarred for rep
Been locked up and lost a step
Targeted for causin dollars kept
Forced me to take cautious steps
I'm blessed to breathe every single nauseous breath
My brother found hell the same day he lost his breath
And I know I'm I'm blessed to breathe
Every single nauseous breath
Cause my cousin found hell
The same day he lost his breath
Every single day (it's real) I wake I pray
(uh what they know about this)
That it won't be the day I stray away
Ay
Forgive me for what I've done
(what other choice do I have but to bang Christ)
Let me know I'm still your son
(I'm just a moving target)
Right here right now

They'll take me out the first chance they get
Just like my cousin
Just like my brother
Rest in peace to Khalid Daniel Shariff
This one's for you
For the one I never bothered to witness to
Sometimes I feel like it's my fault you feel me?
So I dedicate my life to this ministry

Twenty earthworms eating up your dead penis

Prelude,pop,sestra.,47.0,"[Куплет 1]

Отныне я рабыня этого оружия из дерева и железа! И я буду ему верна!

Это мое оружие. Такого оружия много, но это — мое

Мое оружие — мой лучший друг. Оно — моя жизнь. Я должна научиться владеть им так же, как я владею своей жизнью. Без меня мое оружие бесполезно. Без моего оружия бесполезна я. Я должна стрелять из моего оружия метко. Я должна стрелять точнее чем враг, который пытается убить меня. Я должна застрелить его прежде, чем он застрелит меня. Да будет так…

Я и мое оружие знаем, на что идёт счет в этой войне — не на количество патронов, не на грохот наших выстрелов и не на пороховой дым. Мы знаем, что счёт будет вестись только на убитых. И мы будем убивать

Мое оружие это человек, такой же как я, потому что это мое оружие. Я должна относиться к нему, как к своему брату, Я должна изучить его слабости и его силу, его части и принадлежности, его прицел и его ствол. Я должна хранить его от губительной погоды и от повреждений так же, как я храню от всякого вреда свои ноги и руки, свои глаза и своё сердце. Я должна хранить свое оружие чистым и готовым. Мы станем частью друг друга. Да будет так",0.8041674447013065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have A Nice Day,pop,Bing Crosby,150.0,"When it all comes down

I hope it doesn't rain on your parade

I hope it doesn't land on you

When I woke up this mornin'
I fell out of my bed
I burnt my toast an' coffee

The words that they were sayin'
With my elbow in my ear

I believe in Jesus
An' what the Bible said
An' I am fairly certain
He had himself a heavy head

He stared the lyin' people
So bad, they hung him dead
An' they never even listened
To what he really said

He said, ""When it all comes down
I hope it doesn't land on you
When the truth is found
I hope it will be true to you.""

Czujemy popęd naszych serc
Mòwisz do mnie posłuchaj bicia serc
Odpowiadam słyszę uderzenia iskier od zewnątrz stykających się 

Kocham Cię

Latamy na rydwanie żaru
A na rękach naszych serca wyrysowane Henna

Now they stuck with them handguns

I hand none niggas no credit, you see I'm iller than most
I'm kinda illy with the hands, but I'm iller with toast
My guns go pow, so how you like me now?
Been in your hood, niggas ain't that gangsta
Yeah y'all overrated, so we gonna do it or not?
Or we can go to Iraq on M.U. block
I have my pitbulls tear you up
I have my lil' homies in the hood, come and just, scare you up
You don't - be in the hood, you a weak-ass clown
And when you come through, you have your niggas holdin you down
And when - I hold heat I just hold it for delf
Why ask a - nigga to shoot when I'ma buck myself?
I keep my gun by my dick so I can touch myself

On M.U. block yo cause I don't care

If you a bitch, yo we niggas that'll slap your ass
Whattup cliqua?  We can be lah, M-A

I even ran trains with my A&R Gino
Sometimes, I drink Smirnoff without no juice
And I'ma ride for my niggas, Baby D and Dukes
Thugged Out and M.U., we just tripled our troops
We added more niggas, and gave 'em gats and boots
And for the niggas that bend down get minks and goose
See me, I'm not greedy, not at all
Hit me at the office, yo 2-1-2, 5-6-3, 8-4-8-4
So why y'all niggas gon' wait for, runnin out of state for?

Police State,rap,James Bomb,4.0,"[Verse]
Since the Declaration of Independence
Black man in America have been held in place by corrupt governments
Beaten and burned at the stake
Killed if you speak the truth
You can't tell me life was meant to be this way
Black man dominated by white sheets
Feared
White supremacy is the personality of America
A police state
Gun down by police dog
Executed in public
Eye witnesses had video cameras
And it went viral in seconds
That was a hate crime
By the people who protect and serve
They murder black men, women and children
The police declared war on the black community
They say we all are a criminal race
Violence chosen and usually it's a black thing
It's a police state
They taking back the inner cities of America
It's a conspiracy
The new word for black is urban
The feds sanction it because they don't say nothing to stop it
The schools is designed for us
To graduate to prison
That's owned by the corporation of America
We are all brainwashed by one sentence
All men are created equal
Not in America
It's a police state
Race in America was divided even more
In 1994
By one Orinthal James Simpson
A black man who thought he was white
Until they found a white woman dead in his house
Twenty-three years later we still dealing with race
A police state
From the time our feet hit the shores of America
Our black skin indicted us
Them white sheets and black robes
And blue uniforms with guns on the side of them
You black and get pulled over by the police
It might be a death sentence
America is a police state for black people",0.25028542010113597,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freewrite 1,rap,DJ Jeremyray,10.0,"This is just a random freewrite, no record but was good enough to put on genius:
Just in case people's memory is at stake
Let's hit that base, keep on liberating the take
Cause if it weren't entertainment,I'd be late
To the date of my success and on Key for my rest
The type with the A-R-R or the R-I-P
Prolly be a Ma with D-R-A and the D-I-D
With the red of the bets cause dead is a read
Symbol in which I got lead to not go,so the led
Is my weap' cause I can grab your brain cells
Make it like B.C.-Before Covid or fore' the cell
Cause I took that look and it had shook
My loot when I go in charged with the hooks
Either way,you'd be behind the screen
Listening new ways instead of the old stream
Flowing with curiosity and the audacity to lean
On the CD cause we changing letters
From the time of when the AC was new and better
Everybody goes to the line of webs
It catches you and you scream ""I'm privileged
So you better get me outta this winged wedge!""
Look at the comments it's crooked,bloody? Yes
And now that's what I call a new stream
So I take what I do best, and adjust
The work,cause I write books
Like this stupendous, white idle writing title
Kid who stood tall like 6 inch, feddle pride,all
He wanted was to feel loved,as a real dove
Comes over to make him kiss red lips
Picks over the meat sticks and salty perished
Nik's so when he pops the invitalized Vics
He sees the grey-none moving woed hits
Wonders if he'll ever fit in like wind to a gist
Blowin' all over the cold crisp of god's hint
And the chick named Muse Ick gets lust bent
Makes him want to be loose and thick,but sent
With a good package, filled with primed beef
Leaf as the loosen it gets,green,motherly crip
Nips at it with wondering if the fingers are sips
Flips,she can suck vigorously as the ""sane"" chief
Reps the compliment from the working lab
Just to get back to normal,oh fuck

But the batter missed it, cuz he had an itch
My life has fallen into a ditch
Feel like I ain't got a niche
Do nothin' wrong but I ain't a snitch

Can't crawl up and it's scaring me

""Gays Go To Hell""

Donald Trump gon' build a wall
Make Mexico pay for it all
People complain about transgenders allowed in the stall
This crap makes me wanna bawl

""Atheists are evil just like Satanists""

All the Way Up Remix,rap,Meek Mill,151575.0,"[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Catch you out in traffic, it's you and I
Gold 41 in a suit and tie, nigga it's do or die
Seen it now, if I lose it all like who would ride?
But nigga I'm so up, if I tripped it's like suicide
When the internet told me I'm crucified
They was in them streets like, ""Nigga you super live""
I was on the block when you was a sneakerhead
Nigga it's a check up in that box, ain't no shoe inside
Nigga ain't no Nike, ain't no Yeezy, no Jordan V
I came back like I'm Mike wearin' 45
Ever seen 50 grand when it's all in 5s?
But I'm shootin' like the Warriors' startin' 5, swish!
Only rapper went gold without a verse from Hov
Still got the rock with me, cookin' up at the stove
And the Rollie all platinum, know I bust it at Joe
Maybach in the hood, so them suckers can know
I'm in the 6, man, 6 man, Dion Waiters
And I'm on my level now, I'm so beyond haters
Bout to go and grab the Benz truck, see y'all later
When I came through the block, you should've seen y'all faces
This is slaughter, new world order
I be goin' hard, Westbrook, 4th quarter
This is hip-hop, you ain't write it, don't record it
I don't know how they gettin' down 'cross the border
I give 'em the dirty flow, Michigan and water
Sent them 10 thousand cases, I put in my order
Call that poppin' bottles when my people can't afford it
Mixin' D'usse with lemonade when I'm in Georgia
Views from the projects, and nigga I'm the prospect
Talkin' loud, say I'm shootin' out with metal objects
And that chick standin' right beside you, I done popped that
Made me beat a fan up, I'm feelin' like I'm Artest, woo!
Gold mic from the billboards, 'bout to plug it up
Tell Cruz put it in the booth so I can fuck it up
Got the hood super lit, jumpin' like it's double dutch
From the bottom like an uppercut, now I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
You niggas all the way fucked
Switched sides, now you stuck (stay over there my g)
Fuck them niggas though
[Interlude: Fabolous]
This is

They don't wanna see you on top
I just wanna see the streets up
They don't wanna see you up
That's it
They gon' take shots when you all the way up

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I guess they gotta aim up at you
But don't you let these nobodies get their name up on you
Keep the circle tight, never let 'em lame up the crew
If she for everybody, don't you let her claim up on you
Now listen, you gave up on me, I came up on you
Took my talents somewhere else, LeBron James up on you
I was Kyrie with the rock, the crack game number 2
Now I'm older, still ballin' like my name Uncle Drew
They tell you... stay the same, but they change up on you
Niggas change up the crew like hoes change up their boo
I just played the cards they dealt me 'til a change-up was due
Guess I had to switch the dealer or just change up the shoe
Now blackjack, Ace of Spade and a shot of Jack
I met a bad actress, she ain't know how to act
I took her but I brought her back
Don't want her back, I bought her bag
Matte like Hasselbeck, I call my car a quarterback
If I threw it at her would you doubt she could catch?
She hang like a chain so she 'bout to get snatched
Ain't about throwin' subs, I'm about gettin' scratches
But if the shoe fits, nigga, buy an outfit to match it
And you know my boys hold it, we be out with the ratchets
I heard your boys told her you be out with the rats
Keep that on the ""Shhhh!”, nothing less, nothing more
I know the Bad Boys in Brooklyn, they ain't with the Puffy tour
What's up with your Warriors? They ain't lookin' tough no more
Should get out your feelings bro, and get in your duffle, boy
Level up, level up, it's all about that level up
Hold that fuckin' bezel up and light this bitch all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And everytime you see me nigga
Man I'm all the way up

Meek called me and Fab, Joe called Jigga up
She jumped in the 6, 550 wasn't big enough
Reason niggas die, they don't know how to live enough
They can tread water, but they can't swim enough
Nah, I'm built for the physical outing
Besides that, I'm filthy, like municipal housing
J all I know is 500, getchu a thousand
I be in all the hood spots you not allowed in
Opps in the building, automatically alert that
Hand on the wrist so the chrome don't jerk back
Pull it out, you already know you gotta squirt that
I'm all the way up I'm from where the phones don't work at
You gon' need the key from the lobby to slide up
You don't know the key to the body is mind up
Born with it then you don't gotta get signed up
Gotta go when you gotta go, your times up
Extendos, no need for keeping the 9's tucked
I'm kicking you off the ladder for trying to climb up
Yup, overlooking the city
I'm all the way up, I'm like Hov looking at Biggie
It's 50 in the bank, who rollin'? Shoot the 50
If I ace, then these niggas think they hit me
But I'm-

Giuro che se avessi un milione
Lancerei dal balcone almeno la metà

Che il primo milione

Vorrei stare già in pensione (Aria!)
Voglio il reddito universale
Che pure quando uno muore
Gli pagano il funerale
Voglio un monolocale
Con dentro un quadrilocale
Voglio quattro auto
Senza un motivo particolare
Sto sognando come quando
In dormiveglia sono ricco
Conto rosso come quando al sole prendo colorito
Sto viaggiando, sto solo sorseggiando vino
Delirando come in quarantena per un altro anno
Mi sa che mi metto a fare indie
Perché nel giro mio ormai di posto non ce n'è
I colleghi che ce l’hanno hanno le facce giuste
Hanno gli amici giusti e più capelli di me

Ed ora prenderò un amaro, sorseggerò piano
Sto sognando lusso Hawaii sopra un catamarano

Devi avere il fiuto come i cani delle guardie
E appena dopo il primo kappa darti delle arie
Mezzo per l'affitto e mezzo per farti le scarpe
Dire che ti sacrifichi come contributo all’arte
Devo scrivere altre diecimila barre prima del premio Strega
Ma ho le ambizioni borghesi di ogni mio esimio collega
Sei sceso in piazza impettito coi fasci della congrega
Io tutto camo da guerra come Capone e Noreaga
Come si spiega
Lo stress che mi provoca un eritema
Tregua non me ne dà, ma quale giovane età
Mi sta schiacciando la schiena sotto le ruote del tram
Serve una pausa (serve), una vacanza a Lloret de Mar

Samson and Delilah Live at Providence Civic Center Providence RI May 14 1978,rock,The Grateful Dead,14.0,"[Instrumental]

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, Lord, she looked so fine
Delilah she sat down on Samson's knee
Said ""Tell me where your strength lies, if you please""
And she spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson said, ""Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength come as natural as any old man""

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (Right now)
[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man that ever has lived on Earth
Onе day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground, hе saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm, God knows, his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (That's right)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well now, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God knows it, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Outro]
If I had my way

If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way

Something to Dream About,rock,Myka Relocate,908.0,"You push me so far from you
Everything you've done versus everything we've been through
I try to focus on what's ahead
But every time I do I think of you instead
So I'll give it up give it up this time
I'll give it up till it all just fades away
Give it up, give it up, this time
Give it up, till it all just fades away

So what makes it different this time?
I've been running in circles, no end in sight
This will end tonight
No more wasted time
No more wasted time

Now it's time, now it's time
Swallow your lies. We're falling behind
I hate this, you won't let me feel alive
I'm so lost on what to say
Cause I know that this choice is hard to face
Give it up, give it up this time
Give it up till it all just fades away
So what makes it different this time?
I've been running in circles, no end in sight
This will end tonight
No more wasted time
No more wasted time

Go on and take this all into perspective
Go on and take this all right now
I won't try anymore, I won't drown
You are the one thing I'll never live without
I couldn't sleep at night until you gave me something to dream about

I'll always fight for the hopes and dreams of the ones that I love
Never losing sight; you are all that I have to make me feel above

So what makes it different this time?
I've been running in circles, no end in sight
This will end tonight

Happy Kid,rap,STUARTinfk,17.0,"[Letra de ""Happy Kid""]

[Intro]
Yaoh
Hmm

[Verso]
Recuerdo perfectamente el día que dijo que sería padre
Con lagrimas en los ojos, como sintiéndose culpable
Sabiendo qué era mi sueño, tenía dudas razonables
Pintor que aspiraba a rapper no sonaba tan rentable
Se complicó de entrada, días en los que perdía sangre
Y yo muriéndome de impotencia por ayudarle
La abstinencia hizo lo suyo, pa' fumar tenia que alejarme
Y decidí que me coman los nervios antes que marcharme
Más que estar no podía hacer, ella tenía el mayor reto
Y lo hizo con la frente en alto aunque adolorida por dentro
Mientras tanto el padre rapper que seguía pintando deptos
Que jamás alquilaría si no lo hacía con sus textos
Delgada, panza pequeña, así empezaba el quinto mes
Con ese metabolismo que no engordás aunque comés
A mi me pasaba lo mismo, que era más por el estrés
Faltaban cuatro pa' aprender lo que ni en nueve podés
A un mes y medio después, de conflicto y discusiones
Donde cada duda es juez y cada beso perdigones
Pataditas en el vientre calmaron tantos temblores
Que después volvieron pero disfrazados de doctores
Un ecógrafo resentido utilizando tacto frió
Sin medir lo que decía, con un tono presumido
Ponía en duda la fuerza del niño aún no nacido
Sin saber que pasaba, solo que no pesaba lo debido
Dios mío, te estoy rezando, incluso aunque dudo que existes
Te regalaría mi alma aunque, si estás, no la quisiste
Pero no lo hagas por mí, sino por ella que llorando insiste
Que está segura que hará que esto no sea triste
Llegó el día y yo sin haber dormido
Muchas horas de espera, nerviosismo en los latido'
Después de un suspenso ilógico me avisan que está vivo
Pero según sus palabras había nacido deprimido
Dos semanas de incubadora, donde viajaba dos horas
Para solo verlo una y después volverme a sola'
Volviendo a dejarla sola, sabiendo que quizás llora
Pero también que por él jamas tocaría la lona y ahora
Tres años después que parecen tres segundos
Ese bebé deprimido ha crecido y cambiado el rumbo
Me besa, juega, se ensucia, mira con ojos profundos
Y para mí, se parece el niño más feliz del mundo
[Outro]
Yeah, happy kid
El niño más feliz del mundo

Worry Free that's how imma live and that's how imma go
Crazy cause you never really know how life gone go
Worry Free
Yo!

I fly like a butterfly sting like a bee
Keep up with Khalifa way
I’m rolling this tree
Now I live my dream
And it’s all through Worry Free
I just need to flow see
I rarely need to speak
Writing poetry you never see
I’m buzzing like a bumblebee
Drink a whole bottle up of Hennessy
I’m painting out what’s hitting me
Life’s a trip
Stuck between the imagery
Training for this battle
90 knockouts then I go to sleep
People never noticing
Everything controlling me
Write a deep song
Got me fighting with fate
Legends in the making living great
Making music with a cause why you focus on how to floss
Seeing live Logic so you want to be a boss
Worry Free so wavy
They just asked what it costs
Relaxing catch me crafting Eric Clapton
Let me hit the MPC instagram no caption
Don’t steal my energy I won’t let you get a fraction
Jack Johnson with this action x2
Worry Free
[Chorus: Tsxnvmii]
No cap we the pack from the left of the map
Throw all the rest of you rappers where the receptacle at
I’m a spectacle respectable wherever there’s cash
And if you really think you bout it well you better think fast

Oh here come the wave
Tsxnvmii and Young Flash puff passin on the haze
If you lookin action ask the golden state
Cuhz we the Justice league and undefeated wait
My bad I ain’t mean to go that hard yet
I just put my Kill mode on wherever the bar set
I been at the finish line why you ain’t even start yet
Don’t take it for granite just bc I rock the hardest
Alright no cheese anymore
I’m with the squeezin if you squeelin drop the rats to the floor
I’m allergic to vermin I’ll bring my cats to your door
If you ain’t had enough assault well then I’m dashin for more
I’m bout my bread and the fetti no impasta for sure
I’m from the shore where the poorest shoot any shot for a score
Man all this weight on my shoulders from killin beats got me sore
But killa bees is the reason I don’t let up its war

I saw six hooded merchants rolling a wheel barrel of something I couldn't see/
Eight shepherds barged through and tasered all six with alchemy/
Rebirth only plays a roll when someone dies inside but the only resurrection sure to occur is pain beyond your reincarnation/
Scream bullets to acres of land in which carry's utilities, down to the judicious slave master armed with nooses and artillery/
Blacksmiths wages but before they trim machinery, up to burn crosses with three k's nazi from infancy/
Let minds be hooked to technology and magnetized to slave chains
Hoax becomes the offspring in which sources carry no brain waves/
So on your shoulder it seems you hold a motivated devil but an angel that slouches
Mother Mary said she's not your mother and handed you over to orphanage/
Babies no longer parade around in huggies diapers tampering with action figures they play with themselves holding sex toys their first words aren't daddy it's sin/
Communication is not important I just mute my radio frequency because people are talkative like babble mouths and so I watch my wallet/
Skinheads and Hebrews act in war over religious reasonings when the white man tampered with the book you read like translators from overseas/
Prophets surround the pope armed with sacred voodoo merchandise, archaic fashion sort of Ouija with spirits screaming ""someone could get hurt tonight""/
The pope then would confess that he was pimp and then confirm to The Maker he had sinned sold his soul to the black séance by lucifer isms/



Sweet Bayonetta (.//MAGE lushxdeth)
Castles, dungeons which the king has invented
Only your highness can read the bible you unfortunately didn't
Monarchy is like communism the only difference is the suffix ism the practice of a noun in action turning the gears
Blacksmiths ready to wage war on his diciples and stab Malachi in the back because of refusal to murder
Jesters come out at night to play the game sever the fool where they put you in a lock and utilize terrifying tools
Trampolines and genies were imagination brought up to par with mechanics and a bio armor firestarter
Pods and logs of squadrons who ran through the deadly coffins popped the molly of discernment and shouted boy lets get it poppin
Deceased bodies mopping up the blood of sacred beings from the nile of Egypt and the loins of Anubis has escaped the pyramid of Gyza now the worlds have formed together as if the alignment was a beamer
Palm readers fill and feel the room blinded as they are scouting out the traiter like the naked molerat Anwar
Corrections of collections in the inhumane trifector regurgitates the equation of square root of life
Bretheren masacre their bretheren and blood curdling cries at midnight fill up the skies
Populating deadly symphonies to the boneless brash epidermis scatterer
I'm sorry your highness the is an error in the word you speak you see there is more than one immortal overlord which exists within thee
As his anger erupted and veins began to pop his stubbornness transprmed into haterd as Jericho preached the list and six hooded men were slitting their wrists
Nero sets the pentagram of fate putting scarletts into place in such an order it confuses and causes priests to faint
Basing things off of graphic scaling under laws of barak Hussein
Is just as foolish as the senseless spraying of towns in blood over diamond sailings
Illegal preferences gather in such recklessness that sloppy jobs of bounty hunter got the jackpot counterfit
Black mages create such pages of whats left behind of the legend of a Saiyan

Привет...
И не услышу я ответ,
Тебя же рядом со мной нет.

Порой стою под небом тёмным,
Всё вроде кажется знакомым,
В кругу людей я буду скромным,
Теперь я выгляжу бездомным.

Мой дом сгорел в порыве страсти,
Ведь ей всегда хотелось власти,
А ей всегда хотелось сласти,
Когда вокруг царит ненастье.

А вдруг она пропала даром?
А вдруг она пристала хламом,
Лежащий на помойке валом,
Где я приду за ней со шрамом...
Я правда верил до конца,
Что сможет превзойти птенца,
Лететь живее мертвеца,
Когда оставила мальца.

Ты всё же думаешь я слаб:
Я за тебя - пошлю всех баб.
И я тебя бы скинул в ад...
Я не такой... Таков масштаб...

Я буду дальше видеть сны,
Когда мы были влюблены,
Когда мы были так малы,
Когда не сдвинулись умы.

Ты думаешь я буду врать?
На лево право это слать?
Тебя быстрей забыть мечтать.
Пока живой... Не забывать...

Ведь я как ты лишь раз ошибся,
Но с ней во снах бы не кружился.
Ведь даже с ней в слезах молился,
Чтоб быть с тобой - сюжет случился...

Поверь, ты будешь ошибаться,
Но нужно дальше подниматься,
Идти вперёд и не сдаваться!
Я буду в слёзках отражаться.
Ведь ты была той самой,
Была той самой,
Была той самой,
Кто сумел.

Ведь была той дамой,
Кто этой драмой,
Касавшись слабой,
Наверх летел.

Я дальше верю,
Что в лотерею,
Твоей потери,
Не преуспел.",0.36205209512263536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Verso 1]
Tempo perdido com nada por concluir
Um caminho escolhido e um fim que acaba por não vir
É um trip eu sei
Estar fora de rumo sem sequer estar fora da lei
Eu não consigo nem explicar o que sinto no dorso
Tou cheio de pensamentos que nem o 114
E a pensar na colheita vem-me a foice
Mais uma jura que pragado só mais uma noite
Já me vejo rodeado em esquemas

Os meus pecados, limpo-os no banho
Só a tentar safar-me no rebanho
Sei o que tenho, e não tenho
Já que necessidade aqui é a mãe do engenho
Já me nada é estranho, até o que é
E o que não falta é maneiras de remar contra a maré
O que não falta é trafulha e basta uma né
Já que fiz de rendimentos a base da planta do meu pé
E digo-te man suja muito chão a casas
Descarregar aquilo que na tua vida não casas
Que nem periquitos já a ficar sem asas
Por pagamentos em atraso e uma junção de brasas
Como passa é de virar entranhas
Boas horas de sono, aqui são estranhas
Acho que precisava dumas 100 manhãs
De preferência, sem manhas

A Girls Autumn Reverie,misc,Ella Wheeler Wilcox,18.0,"We plucked a red rose, you and I
All in the summer weather;
Sweet its perfume and rare its bloom,
Enjoyed by us together.
The rose is dead, the summer fled,
And bleak winds are complaining;
We dwell apart, but in each heart
We find the thorn remaining.


We sipped a sweet wine, you and I,
All in the summer weather.
The beaded draught we lightly quaffed,
And filled the glass together.
Together we watched its rosy glow,
And saw its bubbles glitter;
Apart, alone, we only know
The lees are very bitter.


We walked in sunshine, you and I,
All in the summer weather.
The very night seemed noonday bright.
When we two were together.
I wonder why with our good-by
O'er hill and vale and meadow
There fell such shade, our paths seemed laid
Forevermore in shadow.

We dreamed a sweet dream, you and I,
All in the summer weather,
Where rose and wine and warm sunshine
Were mingled in together.
We dreamed that June was with us yet,
We woke to find December.
We dreamed that we two could forget,
We woke but to remember.",0.7753221271559596,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sushi  Cocaina,rap,Marracash,57713.0,"[Testo di ""Sushi & Cocaina"" ft. Luchè]

[Intro: Marracash]
La mia città è così contemporanea
Moderna, dinamica, veloce
Così asettica e piena di design
In due parole: sushi e cocaina

[Strofa 1: Marracash]
E yo, bianca vola nei cieli, linee di Nazca
Fino nei quartieri le linee dentro la nasca
Non è un gioco, fra', sasso, forbici e carta
Tratta robe di kappa come la marca
Visi vuoti, Barbari, Visigoti
Sotto i tuoi occhi mentre sei a casa che televoti
Sette chili in sette giorni, però non si ride
Per chi è stato al fresco, frate', sette anni in Tibet
Sto in giro al mattino, fenomeni da baracchino
Non fare il padrino, non sei un ribelle, sei un birichino
Una lettone taglia un etto nel letto a baldacchino
E adora il sushi perché è così moderno, così pulito
Dentro un Range Rover o dentro mobili in rovere
Che aumentano valore se stanno a prendere polvere
Io ne parlo e abbatto muri, Arkanoid
Perbenisti vi ho visti duri, alcaloidi

Yeah, quando l'odio non funziona, inizia la bugia
Odiano in molti, la miseria vuole compagnia
Arrivo col dente d'oro, tu hai narici d'oro
L'hai fatta pippare a gratis, fra', c'hai il cuore d'oro
Più vado avanti e più le differenze si assottigliano (Cioè?)
Sia le brutte che le belle se la tirano
Giù da me si tira, poi si impenna su una ruota
Quella della fortuna, ma poi vanno tutti a rota
Tu odi multinazionali tipo Coca Cola
Ma ti scende roba bianca dal naso, coca cola
Il rap è come una droga, dovresti smettere
Ho tanti sassi nelle scarpe, te li posso vendere
Piovono donne dal cielo, arrivano bagnate
I soldi parlano, raccontano le tue serate
Dalla periferia vado al centro dell'attenzione
Ho novantanove problemi e sono tutte troie

This is a story of a young man who discovered bounce...

Yh (x3)
ZWA!

I’ll explain everything i need around
Love, faith, Queens and Kings, i need a crown
Maybe peace, maybe space, i need a cloud
If you can’t see, i got light, gather around

Bounce bounce, baby, bounce bounce (x3)
Bounce bounce, baby bounce...

(Zwa, Zwa)

[First Verse:]
Bounce with a, bounce with a King
I’m coming thru, zooming in like Ronaldo on the wing
Going rounds for the pound till you spin
I’m AJ, With the mic, i’ll leave you in a ring
I’m louder than loud out the cling, fresh out the box, like the mandem fresh home from the wing
Like how can you, how can you win? It’s winners stays on, so pass the pad, your missing, tek-kers
You ain’t got the touch like Omarion, pity on you
Your moving, reck-less
Your getting thru balls, but silly, your not trynna score
So i’m giving you, lec-tures
On how you juggle your flow, and score some goals, i’m leaving you breathe-less
And I know, that your loving my flow, like where would he go, nutmeg in seconds, ZWA
Bet you didn’t see this coming
So many seasons, i’m whipping that work in that kitchen, can only thank God for the timing
This a new season, got saffron with all of her spices, they’re chilli and hot, so mi like it
Steph Curry this season, a salt bae with all of this smiling
Her friend’s are salty, i don’t mind it, I Tell them to push it
Getting these X’s and O’s, from all of these chicks i don’t know
That won’t be my spouse
Get out if you take that snow, to powder your nose
This ain’t Cory in the house

Angels are all around me, you can’t vamp around me
Put garlic all up in your mouth

Jump in, and jump in, i’m in, like Destiny Childs in a queue
I’m surviving this ting
Don’t push me, don’t push me, i’m in, I’m up in da club where we do things like Marques Houston
Their serving, their serving, some drinks, i’m leaving the club on my ones
I’m so sick of this ting
Like Ne-yo, but not the matrix, I’m good on my ones, i’m a bird
I’m so high, off nothing
Like an Eagle i’m soaring, flying and riding, these storms
The way i perform, you would think i was Robin
Like criminals, all up in Gotham, instead this is London
I’m chilling in mountains
Surrounded by clouds of success and i’m one of the best, in the sky, like a falcon, wait, here’s an announcement
Wait, wait, wait, this is like Smackdown versus Raw
I’m on not your radar, because of my saviour, you’ve never seen a guy like me before
Been through some stress, been on the edge, but i’m still rated wherever i tour
A different Barfest, so don’t book a T, unless your like SZA, with that love galore
Or tell them to kick it, kick it, kick it, like Jean Claude Van Dam
I might have to flip it, flip it, flip it, like Robert Van Dam
A jealous badmind can’t match me, we are not the same
I don’t like their energy, they have the thirst to kill like Cain
[Bridge]

Trynna take me to the ropes, with your clothesline
I’ll switch with you like Will Smith, then 619
Now your laying flat, staring at the sky
Pin, i won the game, 123, it’s in your brain
That ricoch—*GUNSHOT*

Stay in your lane, get to know my name

Place yourself (place yourself) in my shoes
I'm so tired of this abuse

Yeah, I'm always running, running from every problem that I have

I don't want it, all these thoughts attacking me all at once
I feel it coming, darkness is consuming my happiness

And I just wanna lie here, yeah

My mouth only ever opens to spit the wrong thing

[Verse 2]
I like to say, time isn't timeless
But every rhyme is in common
This Grandfather would sing if big ben gave him a sonnet
I know, my rhymes are cryptic
They're for me and I barely get them
But this pen and pad in my solitude
Lays clear my thoughts of pensive be
Havioral inconsistencies I constantly battle within
This paper wet with blood I constantly drain in this pen
Flame to the kin
Of Noir's claim to the sin
Of having this blessing from God
And then laying waste to a hymn
He's bent
I'm sick and tired of it but I
Know nothing will change about me
I'd risk it, I'd risk it all… to change

When She Smiles,pop,Lewis Flinn,1792.0,"Oh, there's a rumor in my heart
It's saying there's a girl about to make me fall apart
Oh, should I run or should I hide?
God! It's like I'm back in junior high

I should just walk on out that door
This is way so much more than I bargained for
So stop staring in her eyes

But when she cries
It's not some ornamental sigh
And when she breathes
It brings the world to its knees
It's when she smiles
It's when she smiles
It's when she smiles

Oh, there's a dreamer in my soul
He's dreaming up a scene where we, like, really lose control
Oh, I think I'm pretty sure far gone
I feel this strange sensation like some poetry's coming on
You're like the sky, so vast and blue
And I'm like a bird getting lost in you
Just floating on your song

Cause when she speaks
It's like my heart just skipped a beat
And when she moves
It's like my world is falling through
It's when she smiles
It's when she smiles
It's when she smiles

And this won't be another road that I didn't take
Not another day with the same mistake
Not another cake that I didn't bake
Not another Snow White that I didn't wake
Not another fear that I couldn't shake
Not another rhyme that I didn't make
Not another rule that I didn't break
Not another love that I had to fake

It's not some ornamental sigh

Trying to balance with you is the hardest

All these tables, bottles service

I've been dripping in my vanity
I'm everything I had to be
I lost a lot of love and now I feel it coming back to me

Quando o terror começar, mil cabeças baterão pra anunciar
A grande chegada de quem nunca esteve ausente
Deu tempo de viver, deu tempo de aproveitar
Mas não deu tempo de correr, cê vai mocar e ficar na frente
Só fica a roupa
Ao soar das badaladas, o sangue jorra
Sigo escrevendo e dentre as linhas busco o efeito da morfina
Pra livrar da dor que afoga
Meus pensamentos em mil planos de chacina
[Refrão]
Foi várias vezes que errei mas não importa agora
A arte mais louca dessa vida é aquela de se reinventar
Faz muito tempo que eu cheguei e nunca vou embora
E o meu conceito de vitória não são views que vão moldar
E tem mais essa agora
São sete anos de história, seis muita gente nem me viu
Mas não importa agora
Os cara é cheio de querer ser
Deixa que o tempo vai dizer quem é o mais pica do Brasil

Disposição regada a neurose e abstinência
Planta que cresce e aumenta a crença
O ódio que nasce e a mente não pensa
Amor assassino, o fim da existência de
Forças maiores, dias melhores
Nova mentira, a soma de alguém
Pelo que cê tem ou quisera ter
E a noite que
Tira o sossego, gente que tira
Tendo o do arrego, o maldito tira
Que mesmo na errada, noite passada
Cão de calada, alguém admira e assim nego se vira
Tendo da mira o primeiro motivo
O que tem que ser, como tem que ser
Sem consentimento do que eu prefiro
Eu sei que nunca dorme
O que vive morre e eu nos conformes de forma uniforme
Tudo prossegue dentro de um roteiro segundo o informe
A fita que chama o fim
Ponto de partida pra um novo começo
Conta, giro quebrado por mim
De fato, disposto a pagar o preço
É o que tudo tem
E nada te falta pra dar sequência
O plano segue a quem persegue
O fácil trajeto por displicência
Incoerência em todo lugar
Insanidade desperta o sentido
Dentro de onde eu quero chegar
Fora do que é permitido
E assim
Novo sentido e a confusão de um peso nas costas
Outra pergunta e a conclusão
Que hoje não se tem mais respostas
Objetivo eu vou
No pulo do gato pra cada barreira
Por enquanto eu sobrevivo
E a meta é viver da melhor maneira

Sem muita história pra contar
Eu fui pra rua trabalhar
Pra ver meu filho crescer
Algo de bom pra ensinar
Motivos pra me orgulhar

Rompiendo ciudades, baby
Esto que vais a escuchar es un disparate
Vamos Gordo, dale, dale
Yo empecé sin nada
Yo empecé sin nada

[Verso 1: GordoMaster]
Los años pasan para todo'
34 y sigo en el lodo hincando codo'
Creo que tú ya sabes de lo que va este lobo ¿o no?
Con 14 empecé a buscar mi flow
Fue difícil en los tiempos de crisis
No era tan fácil, una percha, una media, un antipo'
Sudor y un micro en on
Antes había poca gente con ordenador
Internet no existía ni por asomo hom'
El cassette era la vida, cerveza y calor
Y un coro de niños que lloran a sueños roto'
Lo tuyo se lo lleva otro, buscándome la vida como poco'
Ando yo y mi libreta sin foco', el loco
Con la cara llena de moco' contando el choco
Los picos asustan más que el coco
Criado y rodeado de crows
El Gordo va al loro de todo
Todos los días mi rec hacia clack
Y escupía sin parar mi rap attack
Mi AKA crecía en mí da fuckin' crack
Esquivando sirenas, taqueando el mar
De Málaga city, warrior
Dar la cara aquí es necesario
F-A-T-M-A-N, en el track temen al corsario en serio
No lo hago 4 da' money
Mi lírica es mi imperio
Dime quien te da honey
¿Dime quien más te parte así el tempo?
[Coro: GordoMaster]
Yo solo quiero que veáis lo que hay
Si este camino andáis que sepáis que no es fácil no
Por mucha mierda que vosotros tengáis
Yo empecé sin nada y ahora rompo cada ciudad
Yo solo quiero que veáis lo que hay
Si este camino andáis que sepáis que no es fácil no
Por mucha mierda que vosotros tengáis
Yo empecé sin nada y ahora rompo cada ciudad

[Verso 2: GordoMaster]
Sangre in my way
I'm ready, follow me, dirty, dirty
Mi lengua sucia alimentada con mary, mary
Quiero seguir haciendo mi shit
One life, plasmando vivencias y peripecias
Acrobacias rodeado de mafias que resultan presas
Un camino empinado y lleno de piedras
Y a ciegas no puedes subir
Son palos crudos los que te dá la street
Con veintitantos lo conseguí
Tú no sabes lo que llevo andado hasta llegar aquí
Crecí y me hice mas grande
Mi mierda se hizo más grande
Y fui superándome, entrenándome
Gastando mina día a día y haciéndolo fresh
Hoy quiero mantenerme
Que me dé para comer, que me suba el caché
Vivir de la music sin hiel
Tener mínimo dos bolos al mes
Créeme yo no busco un Hammer
Ni un bling bling coronado de diamante'
Yo no quiero yeyo ni yates, ni bitches ni bache'
Solo una buena racha, sin coches ni flashe'
Con una ""keli"" normal me basta
La pasta no es clase
Las ventas no hacen al hombre, la calle te marca
Sal de tu trance, entra en mi charca
En cualquier fuckin' sendero
Encontraras huellas de esta mi andanza
Y quiebro tu balanza y voy sumando los ceros
Vengo más fiero, no quiero escuchar ni un pero
El Gordo entra y desmorona tu credo
[Coro: GordoMaster]
Yo solo quiero que veáis lo que hay
Si este camino andáis que sepáis que no es fácil no
Por mucha mierda que vosotros tengáis
Yo empecé sin nada y ahora rompo cada ciudad
Yo solo quiero que veáis lo que hay
Si este camino andáis que sepáis que no es fácil no
Por mucha mierda que vosotros tengáis
Yo empecé sin nada y ahora rompo cada ciudad

[Puente: GordoMaster]
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Empecé sin na'
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Rompo ciudades, oh
Empecé sin na'

Caught in the wires
Staring at nothing
Off in a dream, dream, dream
A dream not worth discussing
Cannibalize all versions of myself
Where I wait for the eruption to collapse me into hell

[Chorus]
Caught in a fire
Buried with you
Off in a dream, dream, dream
All I know is right now, I'm through

[Verse 2]
Head underwater
The baffled king composing, hallelujah
Permanent drain
The dirt kicked into foxhole
Covers the door, traps you in
Then they scoff and wait for apologies
Will you kiss their hands and lay back down
And die in a city you've never been?

Mittelfinger für immer,rock,Rogers,344.0,"Ich hab von Allem Alles mitgenommen, was mir den Tag versauen kann
Die Scheiße an den Schuhen reicht ein ganzes Leben lang
Kann für heute nicht mal Schluss sein?
Verdammt, wem hab ich was getan?
Und wenn die Karre jetzt nicht anspringt, komm ich nie zu Hause an
So oft hintereinander kann man doch unmöglich verlieren
Ich glaub ab jetzt kann mir nie wieder was passieren

Ab jetzt hab ich Glück für immer! Für immer scheint mir die Sonne aus dem Arsch
Mittelfinger - für immer – werd ich im Regen nicht mehr nass
Der Terminkalender leer, aber das Bier ist immer voll
Mittelfinger für immer, für immer
Ab jetzt gönn ich mir den Spaß

Gerade heut kommt's mir so vor, als wär ich süchtig nach Problemen
Ich such immer nach dem nächsten Ding, ums mir so richtig schön zu geben
Fahr ich jetzt Vollgas an die Wand oder nur in den nächsten Stau?
Ich bin sowieso schon voll am Arsch
Ja das weiss ich ganz genau, irgendwas muss ich jetzt ändern
Ab jetzt wird positiv gedacht
Ab jetzt bin ich der Letzte, der lacht
Ab jetzt hab ich Glück für immer! Für immer scheint mir die Sonne aus dem Arsch
Mittelfinger - für immer – werd ich im Regen nicht mehr nass

Close Your Eyes / Light of Hope,pop,Steve Wynn,39.0,"When they bring down the curtain
In an hour and 45 minutes
We can talk about the play
And pretend that we were never in it

Flashes lit up the skies
Thunder and then surprise
You can close your eyes

When the earth shakes
Opens up and swallow itself
I won't be thinking about anybody else

Fury and fire flies
It's too late for compromise
You can close your eyes

Words turn to anger
Anger comes to blows
Nobody feels the hit but everybody knows
When nothing can tantalize
It's gonna take a new set of lies
You can close your eyes",0.3201545476913452,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fuckin' renegade
And someday I'll take my place
Up on center stage
But I'll do more than just entertain
I'll educate the masses
And when they take my classes
They'll generate a massive
Change: in trends in fashion
And ways we use our ration-
Ality
This is my principality
I'm sick of all the hype and fallacies
YOLO
For a no-show
Downtown in SoHo
If you're a douche I'll slap you
Especially if you're in the front row!
That's' just convenient
'Cause I'm a deviant
I leave you six feet deep in the cement
With your hopes and dreams covered in semen
Just look at the recent self-proclaimed decent
Self-made emcees that
Keep claiming to be competent
But they suck like every song they're in
It's true that I've become a nuisance
But the truth has to be proven
Thus givin' you a new sense
Of success
Fuck yes
I can get better
All you can do:
Is suck less
If I must guess
What you'd spit
It probably be about fuckin' a bitch
Gettin' high or killin' other emcees that spit
But you don't have a bar that's worth shit
I'm Bar None
A lyrical arson
I'll spit pyrotechnics
While I fuck two chicks in a lexus
And I ain't even ambidextrous
I'm evil
So don't fuck with my methods",0.2956170423422009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I gotta get there early to get a good spot

So many pretty ones swimmin' on by
Doin' everything I can to catch their eye

Gonna throw a little bait in the river
Toss out a line try to reel 'em in
If all I get is a nibble
I'll come back tomorrow and try it again
There's a plenty of fish in the sea
I'm about to get one hooked on me
If I throw a little bait
Throw a little bait in the river

My best buddy, he's got one on
Hope she got a friend that wants to tag along
Lucky is the one that got away
Keep thinkin' she might come back some day

So I throw a little bait in the river
Toss out a line try to reel 'em in

I'm about to get one hooked on me
If I throw a little bait
Throw a little bait in the river, river

And maybe I'm tryin' to fish too deep
She's lookin' for fun, not somethin' to keep
I'm thinkin' she just caught me

Say That to My Face,pop,Guster,499.0,"[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
'Round the corner
Loneliness still following me
I can't shake her
My mother said 'Now don't be scared to fight'

[Verse 2: Ryan Miller]
So I should feel no shame
I should never turn the other cheek
Come and say that to my face
And shyness will keep me in place

[Chorus: Ryan Miller & Adam Gardner]
Love always comes
Love gets her way
Love bites my tongue
Then love goes away

[Verse 3: Ryan Miller]
Shyness, fear, and shame
Whisper all those things about me
Come and say that to my face
Words that I think but don't say
[Chorus: Ryan Miller & Adam Gardner]
Love always comes
Love gets her way
Love holds the tongue
Then love is gone
Say Neil Armstrong
Where is the Sun?

[Outro: Ryan Miller]
For shyness, fear, and shame
Have wrapped their arms and legs around me
Come and say that to my face
When will it be that
I don't feel no shame?
There's a sin that's coming on me
Come and say that to my face",0.5655891746282578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smokin' Agent Orange, Hi-C
Back when me and friend was recordin' at my grandma's
Most of y'all were chasin' around bops
Always in the lab, only hoping that my job
Never would be based around mops now I'm on
Yeah, she know; love me cause my ego
Girls and the drugs always follow us where we go
Ay, where the Bay at!?
Lookin' for the party girls, let me know where they at
Skinny rich girls always askin' where the yay at
Throw a house party like cool, where you stay at?
Turn upside down, let her twerk on the wall
Took her to the bathroom and did work in the stall

From the BART train to a tour bus
Still the same game except I'm pulling more sluts

All these Bay sounds, Mac Dre is who I grew up on
I'm just selling game got you if you need a coupon
You can check my resume, see every beat I threw up on
Smoking on grapes, rollin up swishers, no papes
Back of the Ghost, closed drapes
I'm a boss tycoon
Girls in the crowd all swoon
Super high, I'm off to the moon
And I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room
She wants me to slay ooh-kay, that means doom
Boom, and it's to be expected
Knew this would happen as soon as she texted

Thank You,rap,Dame D.O.L.L.A.,4524.0,"[Verse 1]
Remember back when I was five, I seen my grandmother's pride
Care-taking for friends and watched a couple die
Grew attached to how you love and what you had inside
Never held your tongue, wasn't lettin' nothing slide
Learned early that you gotta give credit where it's due
Who better to start with, I gotta start with you
All them days when you was sick and hustling us all to school
Character and confidence, you gave us all the tools
Got a whooping if we need it but thinking how we was treated
You saw something in us way before we could've seen it
All them long ties with the cousins out the phoenix
Everybody got in trouble when they laughed at me for being
Boy I couldn't do wrong, that's how you made me feel
When I ain't made grades, you saved me from getting killed
Remember bringing you the bags where you carried all your pills
My parents separated; you was loving me for real
Thank you Granny

[Hook]
Say your prayers, be for real
You know I am so proud of you, keep your head up
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
I want you to be a man, stay true
Don't let nobody get over you, be for real
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
I'm watching over you in the sunshine
[Verse 2]
What the Ds and Fs stand for? Doing fine?
What yo little ass know about grind?
You make money at night but with the son you gon' really shine
You gon' get rich just rich for time
You start selling with the mess, you coming down mixed up
Interrogations, that's when your friends gon' switch up
If you Kobe, why deal with the ground beef?
That's a problem on the street, just ask dudes, everybody
You ain't make that team, but can't hate it
We all learn from that, then little Damian made it
Hugh is still scrambling, John is still stacking
Chris fixing the whips and Kenny making it happen
The boat going down with the captain
Lead by example they really watching your actions
Conversations with my grandmother
Them talks saved me man, I hella love her

[Hook]
Say your prayers, be for real
You know I miss a part of you, keep your head up
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine

You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
I'm watching over you in the sunshine
[Verse 3]
To the villains that raised me little knucklehead
I ain't got nowhere to go that was enough said
It was chili, spaghetti, gumbo, and spare ribs
Everybody got their plate but that ain't chip in
When it was Christmas, a man put my name in a hat, made me feel a part of something, I was thankful for that
When it was late you tell me, I knew where the blankets was at
It mean that you got right to the back
I be like, ""Granny, it's me""
When I came in hella lit and nobody never understood what grandaddy said
But you always felt the love and just nod your head
Believe the greasy, you always said
You cosign with that
And when the heater broke, he left the stove on that mat
You always kept it 100 I was on my hype
You left the door unlocked and it saved me life

[Hook]
Say your prayers, be for real
You know I miss a part of you, keep your head up
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
I want you to be a man, stay true
Don't let nobody get over you, be for real
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
I'm watching over you in the sunshine
[Verse 4]
You original Clarence Street, nobody can compare
Used to make us drop down and say the Lords prayer, became the routine we did it when you wasn't there
I quit football, you told me ""Show 'em you ain't scared""
Gave me that inner faith, gave me nothin' to fear
Then I went and got Defensive Player of the Year
""Treat people how you wanna be treated,"" that was your slogan
I love that wrestling and you bought me that Hulk Hogan
Still watching people kids, still cooking dinner
Foundation strong 'cause it's you that's at the center
Too many acts of kindness you doin' with no agenda
Half blinded, one eye with a great set of antennas
Told me I could probably catch a fish with yo hook hat
Drink some alcohol you was telling me I look dead
I was in the wrong you said you wouldn't tell my mama
Ain't nothin' like a person that can always keep a promise

[Hook]
Say your prayers, be for real
You know I miss a part of you, keep your head up
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
You know I'm watching over you in the sunshine
I want you to be a man, stay true

Inner City Kid,rap,davecreates,80.0,"[Intro: davecreates]
He was an inner city kid
Innocent, in a sin city with
Survival on his mind
This is his story
Hear his heart
Hear his cry...

[Verse 1: davecreates]
Inner city kid in a globe full of vultures
In a city with stripper poles and the potion
Mum crying every night praying in devotion
Devil slaying every night preying on the broken
And who do you trust in the belly of the beast, if they'll turn on you when you try and leave?
What a time to be alive
All he can see is grey in his sky
Wondering if he'll live forever when he dies
In this city full of vices
The advice he's getting is leaving his mum sweating in her sleep
Six feet is pretty deep
For a twenty something
Always stunting
It's just stunning how he's still standing on his feet
When she hears the sirens scream
Is this the night were
Her reality is turned into a nightmare
A knock on the front door
Could be a church friend or a church funeral
She knows that she has to attend

But no one wants to see me go
No one wants to see me go
Alone, do I walk this road alone?

[Verse 2: davecreates]
""BULLET PROOF"" tatted on his chest
Since a young g
Ridding with the boys from the block
Won't stop
Never seen daddy since he came here
Earth is looking something like a prison on the rocks
Prison break, prison break, tell me is it late
Chase the money and the fame
Get it in
Never settling till he sees the top
But lately life is pressing him for everything he got

Getting out the city was a life's dream
Thought he had the right team
Brothers in arms
Brothers now armed with attitude and armor
They sense that he wanted to leave
They give him drama
Deadly look in their eyes like assassins eyes on the prize
And now they feel betrayed like a Judas kiss to the face
Who's a friend or an enemy
Garden of Gethsemane vibes
All he knows is that he's meant for something greater in life
He's gotta live

But no one wants to see me go

I'll fall away, and I won't regret the things I used to say, with no more shame. It's time for a change of pace now. There's things I can't erase now. Come help me out, 'cause until now I've done it by myself. And after everything, at least I still have my health. I've been broken down, and I've been burnt out, but you make that feel so far away. So I'll let you take the lead this time, to show me everything will be alright. Because if there's hope for guys like me, then maybe there's a chance that I can finally forget about the past, and just believe. Break away, this time's no different. I'm headstrong, and I can feel it. The old me needs some policing? Well, that's not my jurisdiction. I'm calling out the ones that brought me down. Please stick around, 'cause thanks to you, I'm so much better now. Back against the wall, I was about to fall. And I don't know what to do. No, I don't have a clue this time. Standing here alone, I'm shaken to the bone. I'll try to find another way.

Rasselas Prince of Abyssinia Chap. 7,misc,Samuel Johnson,3.0,"The Prince Finds a Man of Learning

The Prince was not much afflicted by this disaster, having suffered himself to hope for a happier event only because he had no other means of escape in view.  He still persisted in his design to leave the Happy Valley by the first opportunity.

His imagination was now at a stand; he had no prospect of entering into the world, and, notwithstanding all his endeavours to support himself, discontent by degrees preyed upon him, and he began again to lose his thoughts in sadness when the rainy season, which in these countries is periodical, made it inconvenient to wander in the woods.

The rain continued longer and with more violence than had ever been known; the clouds broke on the surrounding mountains, and the torrents streamed into the plain on every side, till the cavern was too narrow to discharge the water.  The lake overflowed its banks, and all the level of the valley was covered with the inundation.  The eminence on which the palace was built, and some other spots of rising ground, were all that the eye could now discover.  The herds and flocks left the pasture, and both the wild beasts and the tame retreated to the mountains.

This inundation confined all the princes to domestic amusements, and the attention of Rasselas was particularly seized by a poem (which Imlac rehearsed) upon the various conditions of humanity.  He commanded the poet to attend him in his apartment, and recite his verses a second time; then entering into familiar talk, he thought himself happy in having found a man who knew the world so well, and could so skilfully paint the scenes of life.  He asked a thousand questions about things to which, though common to all other mortals, his confinement from childhood had kept him a stranger.  The poet pitied his ignorance, and loved his curiosity, and entertained him from day to day with novelty and instruction so that the Prince regretted the necessity of sleep, and longed till the morning should renew his pleasure.

As they were sitting together, the Prince commanded Imlac to relate his history, and to tell by what accident he was forced, or by what motive induced, to close his life in the Happy Valley.  As he was going to begin his narrative, Rasselas was called to a concert, and obliged to restrain his curiosity till the evening.",0.5577562060207129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So much coke got coke in jail
In the white Rolls Royce wit my man Pharrell

But I'm a take it back to the early 80's
Where my couzin Stacey had the pearl Mecerdes
My aunt-couzin Wamp had the black on black
Ac' Coupe Legend wit the gold in the back
I was just a lil' youngin running wild as hell
Running 'round wild trying to get that mail
Lil' shorty whose trying to learn the rules
I was twelve years old brought the tool to school
Cause I was quick to flip, quick to sell that shit

Now we can Rock N' Roll, I got a roll of rocks
And when you hear {*sirens*} there go the cops
When the block get hot, homie we gon chill
And bid like 22 mill, we could plan a deal
My light too real for me to act like you
I'm playing wit too much paper to put slacks like you
You could call me Betty Crocker cause I'm baking them cakes
And when I cross the interstate, I'm switching up plates
I'm watching the Feds, they're watching my moves
I'm paying my dues, I'm spraying my tools
We never play by the rules
You might hate to lose if you play wit us
You ain't heard? Me and my homies keep them K's wit us
You'll stop - drop, roll, we'll shoot ya in the head
And when I'm chasing my bread, I'm shaking the Feds
And I'm - packing my lead, y'all ain't ready for me

I got street birds, and I keep 'em in my pouch
Play wit my money and I turn into Oscar the Grouch!

Touch with hands of silk my skin

We'll drown in this silence with no more fears

Pale bodies embraced till night is past

T'avvolgerò con ghirlande d'acqua
Fino a farti mancare il respiro
Entreremo, per mano, nell'eterno mare
Scivolando su sentieri di cristallo
Giungeremo a immoti fondali dove
Tra distorte regge di vetro
Ebbri di una fatale danza
Stremati ci addormenteremo
Diafani corpi avvolti l'un l'altro

Hablé con Dios aunque no le importa cómo me siento

Hablé con Dios aunque no sé si es real

Escuché que el mal es silencioso (El mal es silencioso)
Sé que mis demonios se quedan callados (Mis demonios se quedan callados)

Ahí es cuando arañan y pelean

Miré abajo cuando vi a mi hijo caer en un campo
Dejé que su corazón se derrumbara y luego le enseñé a sanar
Dejo que me pida orientación
Conocí sus preguntas en silencio
Ocultando las respuestas por dentro, siempre supe que lo encontraría

İnanmam,rap,Kamufle,569.0,"[Hook](x2)
Yok, bu kadar olmaz!
Yok, tesadüf olmaz!
Yok, sevgi tükenmiş dediler inanmam!
İnanmam sana, inanmam yalan!
İnanmam asla, inanmam!

[Verse 1]
Sevgi nedir ve sen ne hissettin?
Sevişmek mi, geviş getirerek gelişmek mi?
Yoğun mide bulantısı ya da çelişmek mi?
Beş duyu organınla hislerine yenilmek mi?

Sevgi akıl almaz boşluklar doldurursa
Biladerim doğru yola girdin demektir
Emektir, hayatını gözden geçirmektir
En heyecan verici anlarını yüksek hissetmektir

Gel gelelim yaran varsa, aranmak demektir
Direktifleri yanlış almış işine yalan gereksiz
Gerçekçi olmak gerek, çok sesli karekterine
Aşk bugün bahşedilen günahsız bebektir
Sevgi bencil, hayli fazla rengi
Her tarafta etkin, yani bir bakıma resmi
Ve sessiz, sen kim olursan ol yine zevkli
Sefasını süren insan olur gayri resmi

[Hook](x2)

[Bridge: Bilge Kösebalaban]
Sevmek hoş, mutluluğa koş!
Hayat çok boş, yalandan coş!
Tüm aşklar, hep riyakar!
Kalır hep, yanlarına kar!

Harikalar diyarından sevgi tohumları gelir anı yaşa

""Savaşma seviş!"" e büyüklerimiz demiş
İstanbul ufak ama inan bak gönlü hayli geniş
Kimimiz reşit, kimimiz değil, kimimiz yaşlı olgun
Potansiyel dünyamıza bir anda destek olur sevinç

Cest la vie,pop,Al Bano,18.0,"C'est la vie c'est la vie
O niente o così
È fiato e cuore
È prendere o lasciare
È lacrime e sudore
Ma dico ancora sì

C'est la vie... c'est la vie
Va bene così
Io vado avanti
Tra i suoi imprevisti venti
Perduti appuntamenti
Ad aspettare un sì

Io l'ho imparato sai
Che pure dentro il fuoco
Una speranza c'è
Ed ho capito ormai
Che per restare in gioco
Ho solamente me
Piangerò, perderò
Ma non credere che io cadrò!
C'est la vie... c'est la vie
Un giorno sei lì
E in un momento
Il tempo ha consumato
Il mondo conquistato
E ridono di te

Ho maledetto me
Quando si alzava il vento
E tu non c'eri mai
Chi mi ha salvato poi
L'orgoglio o il sentimento
Forse i nemici miei
Ma non ho fretta più, no, no
Certe regole ormai le so!

C'est la vie... c'est la vie
Va bene così
Non c'è certezza
Ma per una carezza
Io scenderei all'inferno
Per questo sono qui

4 Days In The Trap,rap,Huskii,5282.0,"[Verse 1: HUSKii]
Mind buzzing from these stupid fiends
Doing runs I feel like Uber Eats
Half the junkies been shooting needles
Where we meet they all through the streets
Who's to blame here?
You or me?
I don't wanna be sellin rock
But the crew we all gotta eat
Fuck the coppers who try to watch
I ain't saving to buy no watch
Three phones and these cunts don't stop
I should set up a run through job
Then set him back up in front two boxes
I been that obnoxious
Fuck the world I've been crossed too often
Fill the boot you see lights no stoppin
Keep your head down you might get got
Everybody want a piece of the pie
Ain't nobody want to start from the bottom
Everybody got a piece or a knife
Only got em cause they're scared of a floggin
I ain't here to start fights no
Only been stating the obvious
I knew a few that get pulled in for interviews
100% that they doggin us
Cut up blocks in a vacant flat
Fuck the dogs yeah I hate the jacks
Fuck a job I ain't payin tax
Suckers watching me makin stacks
[Pre-Chorus]
4 days in the trap
Same shirt same tracks on

[Verse 2: ChillinIT]
Granddaddy had a fruit shop and got his hustle on up out of Lebanon
Now your grandson is on the 2 pops so we sell stuff when we gettin on
Hurstville with the Chinese
Mixed three cups with the kettle on
I was 17 with the M rock in a rehab outta Wollongong
Way back
Old days
Money bags to the blue Mazda
Old mate played loan sharks for the 100 packs of the blue Mazdas
Played friends they all snakes
All nominees just true actors
Missing friends over missing money from the kitchen drawer brother who snatched it?
Still be acting real
Still be catching deals
Still be making sure these packages get properly vacuum sealed
Give no ucks ucks ucks
Give no ucks bout how you feel
Still be real
Still be catching deals
Still be catching meals (meals)
Riding round bumping Triple J
When I turn it on yeah the joint is mine
RIde around puffin Triple Js
When I burn it off yeah the joint is mine
Go back to the same flats
Cause he sells grams that are .9
But you never ever sold one thing
Stop fronting there's no point in lying

4 days in the trap
More paper more cash
They buzzing my phone when I'm out
That can all wait till I'm back
In the hallways in the flats
Your courts facing my lap
My lawyer's saving my ass again
My court cases get dashed
My gina looking like floor cleaners
We reelin out of this four seater
If you talk heaters
Gonna force me to put a hole in your neck like a store beeper
Funds float for these drug homes
My plug knows that I'm cutthroat
Feed a pregnant bitch rock till I kill two birds with one stone
Riding round with them scammers
Hiding out from them cameras
My hype is out in South Gina
How you gonna find me now I go phantom
Thinking you ain't been up in the streets lad
My mates snaked me for a speed bag
Switch thought he was a big boy
Turned outcast for like 3 stacks

Got the money through the fly screen
Everybody want that ice cream
Everybody copy my steez
Till they realize it was just a pipe dream
No yes men on my team
My best friend speaks Chinese
Don't ask why this white Beamer we driving needs to get wiped clean
Fuck it
I feel like burning some bridges down
I feel like turning some bitches out
I feel like shit when I wake up so I'm getting high till it's good to go into town
It's way too red hot to sit around

Festering Tears,pop,Appalling Spawn,13.0,"I met a human who died many centuries ago
""Around myself wreathe your arms"":
He said without sound
Without movement
Nevertheless I heard him
Ecstatic magnificence bloomed
For a split of eternity
In a garden of weeping senses
And swallowed up all my perceptions...
""Your solitude has thrown you between
Waking and dream, between us and them
Between soil and fertile emptiness
I feel the tears festering inside of your
Land, please let them out
Release the sadness of your spirit
He is crying for HOME!"" AND I OBEYED
In his purgative emprance that
As a messengers from somewhere else
MY SOUL ENTERED...
I delightfully trembled as though
Anticipating the most distant
And the nearest breath, breath the most precious!
My fear was getting smaller with his every touch
""Become absorbed in deep yourself
Till you will be integrated with me.""
""Breathe your soul, let it pervade
Beyond the Earth of mind
Beyond the oceans of dreams
There where your experience does not reach
There I shall take you and then you will realize
The crown of the masters you will
Put and let the tears
Festering for thousand years flow AWAY!!!""",0.7611123789101839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Droves of styles older than sharkskin, now commit the barking
I gather rhymes and load up, 'cause it's a hold-up
I meditate fast to assassinate a class, a dull sword
Check the graphics on this rap chalkboard
Peace to RZA Razor, yo, the nigga's major
Who slice tracks fast like whities with Gillette razors
And won't stagnate, the ragged Dragon Lee
Regenerate, clearin' the area, air out and ventilate
See, yo, I'm natural, swift like a mackerel shark
Gat-packable, attackable in this art
Now watch a beat that makes and shakes and breaks ya
Ron G makes a million off his name, son
Ayo, peace to uptown, Shaolin now
Walk through, child, it's wild

Yo, I got piles and piles of my styles to utilize
And brutalize niggas who despise 'cause I'm super fly
There ain't a nigga in the game who can tame me
I flip A&Rs if they try to rearrange me
So how the fuck do you figure you can hang
With a nigga whose slang is equipped to pick a nigga's brain?
I come hard to the fullest scar
From pulling cards, to leaving niggas scarred on the boulevard
Check my steez, my rep is kept pleased
Like these biceps that I flex when I crack your knees
A homicide in the making, you enter the chambers
And sentenced to death for move-faking
See mad thoughts fill the mind of a Killa
Sin is iller than your ordinary blood spiller
When it's time to come into the track
I'm like a maniac, slapping your stack when it's all back
What? 1994, give it to ya raw
Mix king records, word up
That's what I'm talkin' about

Easy soundboy, 'ere watch ya chat
Allow me to set the party off with the fly rap
Aye-aye, cap, suckers wanna battle give me mine
You rhymes wouldn't be fly if you said them on Delta Airline
Now this'll take a second, Kris has come to bug out
You waiting for some lovey-dovey, hug me, get the fuck out
I got the hardest texture, lecture or whatever
I got to survive G, I ain't no saint
I do graffiti art, but like Martin's home decorating center
I ain't, just, paint, wait, wait
Wait, wait, let me speak, let me speak
While I'm on this beat your career is looking bleak
I couldn't understand why you were coming soft and sweet
But that explains why your rhyming skills are weak
You need a quicker picker-upper, rip a sucker
Put my album on toast 'cause it's butter
You dissing me will never happen slightly
That's like Arsenio Hall on TV saying, ""Kill whitey""
You might be slightly thrown off at my complexity
Lyrical ecstasy is achieved by standing next to me
You should of known your career was gonna end
Should of called Dionne Warwick and her psychic fucking friends
Now it's ended, can't be mended, how splendid
For wack MC's, I come doctor recommended

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the Pearly Gates
Fuck him, I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my mama got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talking 'bout some ""Praise the Lord"" shit
""Hail Mary""? Fuck her, I never knew her
I'd probably screw her, and dump her body in the sewer
""Our Father""? My pops stuck up dope spots
Big, black and mean, with the fifth by the gabardines
What you expected from his next of kin, huh?
I'm loco, bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if ya wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
The lesson from the Smith & Wesson is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin', the same motherfuckin' question:
How many shots does it take to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake? Ron G, stop the breaks

[Verse 5: O.C.]
Yeah, O.C. representing from Jamaica, Queens like this
You have now stepped into the realm of a man
With topics, open your optics, I rhyme for what I stand
Brace your boxes and stereo decks
I'm here to do more than just collect checks
So get fixed to the wheel of force, see, I'm the Jedi
When I'm in flight it might be like the red eye
Swift, take a wiff of my vocabulary
I'm wild like berries, I pop it like a cherry
Ron G composed it, everyone knows it
Life brings death from guns to roses
Shoot outs, put doubts of a nigga to a test
Shit is hex so I just might get a vest
But what good is a vest if you're aiming for the dome?
Kick it from a janny-port nickel plated chrome
Blast you in the face, massacring niggas
Figuring the referee foes that's bigger

Я продукт, что создали мои трущобы
Я возмущаю, как ребенку накончать на скобы
Дъявол выложил в торренты все мои альбомы
Чтобы откинулись от шока детки после школы

[Бридж 1]
Меня выкинут из дома, потом вкинут в кому
Стану любимой клиентурой я за барной стойкой
Буду забывать слова свои у микрофона
Потом продам  свои фиты я за микрогонорар
Чтобы здесь все сторчать
И снабжать иногда свою тянку духами по скидке
Потом леди захочет испы-испытать в своей вагине чей-то хуй с протеином

[Бридж 2]
Тики-так, hi my names
Фрики, фрик  ебашить жизнь намерен
Кликай в Твиттер лайк, чтоб купились

Ой, ой, я снова перешел на “ты”
Кончать в тебя под наркотой – так меня воспитали
Ты можешь выключить меня, мамин baby boy
Ты дождешься, когда в порно моем накончают

В моей гримерной от и до – от швали до шмары
Склеешь ласты ты как лох в середине пати
Не знаю, сколько тараканов влезло в мой скафандр

Моя музыка – гипноз, так я сюда пришел
Забитый  лох, что 3 года не выходил из дома
Поднимал много лавэ, но проебавший все
Сюда вернулся за новеньким миллионом
Но не бери с меня пример – я плохой кумир
От меня отказалась мать, у меня нет друзей
Я покупаю женщин, чтоб с ними говорить
А в остальном у меня все окей

Я сам себе на уме, лям в кошельке – мой мини-мини-минимум
Конкурентов нет, ведь заебал весь рэп
Я выдержу, вынырну, выживу
Передавай привет на Битвы за респект

Я тот, кто продал героин твоему ребенку
Я тот, кто порвал твою псину в твоей футболке

Упс, упс – перебор, так-так не надо
Мой дъявол давит улыбу, повышая зарплату
Деньги не пахнут и я  трахну все в тексте новом
Критики, отъебитесь – объект невиновен

[Куплет 4]
Я вылез из пизды у худших сословий
Влез в рэп – ваши дерзкие тут побледнели
Никто не может так как я, ведь я трахнул пошлость
А после напишу стишки, и мне опять поверят

[Бридж]
Но никакой луны и вторых планет
Мы тебя трахнули, смешав что-то в твою колу
После расскажешь своим шкурам “было все окей”
Но тебя трахнули, смешав что-то в твою колу

[Куплет 5]
В распоряжении меня было всего 7 клавиш:
До – ре – ми - ля, но лирика так заебала
Я хочу пляски и танцы, и прочий шабаш
После проктолог, гинеколог клитору скажет “мама”
[Бридж]
Мы  тут не причем – зай, у нас турне
Ты как-нибудь без нас – кис, у нас концерты
Ты как-нибудь сама – зай, у нас лавэ
Ведь мы найдем суку получше, чтоб в нее все втиснут

Obiecaliśmy sobie tyle że niemożliwe nabiera nowego znaczenia jak stacja w święta
Ja odpalam szkło i wpadam w slowmo (Siema Lucyfer) witam na smutnej płycie
Bo martwi mnie tło szare jak ona gdy w weekend definiuję życie
Boli mnie jak kalkulujesz i dajesz im moje życie na tacy
Jest lepiej, jesteśmy wszędzie; Los Pepes
Definiuje nas codzienność wariaty, jak nie mam siły to nie pierdolę
Ale jak znam wszystkie elementy układanki biorę te lalki w kredo zaraz po szkole
Moich kawałków słuchasz kiedy odpływasz, w łóżku, z daleka od sumień
Moich kawałków słuchasz w domu po buchu i kiedy nakręcasz te niunie na numer
Moich kawałków słucha twoja dziewczyna i wie że też jesteś raperem
Ale masz dwa razy więcej lat niż goście, którzy od roku cię zjadają na scenie
Poproście kelnera, niech coś da, najlepiej coś sezonowego
Jak szukasz frajera to weź kogoś z dwóch ich, najlepiej gdzieś tego mątnego
Biorę to z półki, mam ego jak niebo, ego jak niebo to wiesz
Pierdol się, kurwo - ty też

Wyjebany, jak szafiarki w twoim mieście
Czuję dreszcze, (ja pierdolę) czuję dreszcze
[Refren: Kartky x Emes Milligan]
Nie udajemy nikogo, nawet jeśli nigdy więcej świat już nas nie zechce
Wychodząc ubieram kurtkę no logo, gdy widzę jak inni się prują za bezcen
Jeśli mnie później zapytasz o resztę, a stare sprawy oprzemy o bar, ay
Zaczniemy od dwieście na mieście, jak za dawnych lat
Nie udajemy nikogo, nawet jeśli nigdy więcej świat już nas nie zechce
Wychodząc ubieram kurtkę no logo, gdy widzę jak inni się prują za bezcen
Jeśli mnie później zapytasz o resztę, a stare sprawy oprzemy o bar, ay
Zaczniemy od dwieście na mieście, jak za dawnych lat

[Zwrotka 2: Emes Milligan]
Spójrz, wchodzę jak ad libitum
Chcą mnie dodać tu, chcą mnie dodać tam, ale
Nie pasuję tam i tu
Tempo daje ruch, jednak wszystko jest szyte na miarę
Jak mój nowy suit, jak Mike Ross i jego pamięć
Tyle że ja dostałem słuch, gdy rozdawali te talenty w bramie
Tysiące karier masz, wszyscy mówią jak, jak masz żyć
Jebany fałsz, nie liczą moralnych strat, łatwo zaprzeczyć
Sobie sprzed lat, w imię zasad, tych prawd, które ktoś wróży jak z kart
Wszystko przez strach, ten idol nie chce być sam, więc ciągle próbuje być jak, nara...(nara)
Nie porównuj mnie do reszty, bo chcę zmieniać szarość w art jak Mr. Banksy, hałas...(hałas)
Za te wszystkie wysłane koperty, potraktuj każdy track, jak haracz za te ich piosenki...

[Refren: Kartky x Emes Milligan]
Nie udajemy nikogo, nawet jeśli nigdy więcej świat już nas nie zechce
Wychodząc ubieram kurtkę no logo, gdy widzę jak inni się prują za bezcen
Jeśli mnie później zapytasz o resztę, a stare sprawy oprzemy o bar, ay
Zaczniemy od dwieście na mieście, jak za dawnych lat
Nie udajemy nikogo, nawet jeśli nigdy więcej świat już nas nie zechce
Wychodząc ubieram kurtkę no logo, gdy widzę jak inni się prują za bezcen
Jeśli mnie później zapytasz o resztę, a stare sprawy oprzemy o bar, ay
Zaczniemy od dwieście na mieście, jak za dawnych lat

No role models and I'm here right now

[Outro: Kartky x Emes Milligan]
Rozerwany, czuję się kompletnie pusty
Chyba te płyty to horkruksy
Pojebany, paru mówi, że mam swój styl
Dobra, chuj z tym, chuj z tym (chuj z tym)

Poetas da Babilônia,rap,Nocivo Shomon,12617.0,"[Letra de ""R.U.A. 2 - Poetas da Babilônia"" com Rincon Sapiência, Nocivo Shomon, Fábio Brazza, ADL, Leal e Allex Flores]

[Verso 1: Rincon Sapiência]
Chegamo no piano, picadilha Beethoven
Se o papo fazer a curva, meus manos nem ouvem
Rap veio do gueto, então tirar de lá nem ousem
O gueto é santuário da cultura, louvem
Verdades são verdades, não encarem como insulto
Já me senti um macumbeiro na igreja, no culto
Já me senti como um intruso no meu habitat
Pode pá, que os sonhos no túmulo geram tumultos
Acúmulos de cédulas, as dívidas, os cálculos
As pólvoras, as pétalas, bem-vindo ao espetáculo
Cansaço dos músculos, cansaço na retina
No escuro dos óculos, disfarce na rotina
Grana, quero ela sem pala, senzala
Já foi, quero grana e o tempo pra gastá-la
Dei dois, surfei, tô no pique do Medina
Nessa onde me curei, música medicina
Uau
[Verso 2: Nocivo Shomon]
E o que restou do paraíso
Drogas e um drinque no inferno
Que o clássico toca igual hit
Que valha milhões meu caderno
Caçando demônio de terno, caneta pesada
Compondo me interno
A moda te torna famoso, sua escrita te torna eterno
Sem apoio paterno, mãinha foi guerreira
Tudo que ela dizia virou hino pra vida inteira
Mais alto do que falador, o grito da ""dona saudade""
Posso ter o mundo inteiro, sem você falta metade
Quanta mãe solteira passando necessidade
Virar o zóin' é bom, difícil é ser pai de verdade
Ser pai não é pra covarde, que faz sem assumir
Mas se a mina abortar, sociedade vai destruir
Meu filho é comedor, virou herói do meus truta
Minha filha é vagabunda se tá na balada de saia curta
Curar nosso machismo, mudar nossa conduta
Quem pode determinar quem é santa e quem é puta?
Já passou da hora de aceitar a diferença
Num mundo imperfeito, preconceito é uma doença
Que suja nossa alma, planta trauma, separatismo
No campo me concentro pra derrubar o nazismo
Salve o vandalismo, largamos letras criminal do Müller
Rap cereal Kellogg's, Nocivo serial killer
Vocês têm Camaro, Rolex e mansão
Mas nunca conquistarão o respeito do Facção
Sopro de destruição
Universo no verso implica
Mente dos menor terra fértil, vocês plantando titica
Todo mundo é foda, todo mundo é pica
Mas quem liberta a coroa escrava de madame rica?
[Verso 3: Fabio Brazza]
O microfone é minha espada e minha guerra é santa
Minha escrita é tão sagrada que é cantada em mantra
Minha palavra é afiada, corta até garganta
Minha caneta é tão pesada nem o Thor levanta
Na madrugada fria, caminhando pela city nos breus
A noite inspira poesia, eu faço um feat com Deus
Penso numa rima, ele completa
Às vezes tenho a impressão que ele tá aqui
De calça larga e aba reta
Poeta, I see the signs
Deus não escreve por linhas tortas, escreve com punchlines
Metáforas em rhymes, até em braile ele rima
E eu me pergunto:
A vida tá escrita ou é ele fazendo um freestyle lá em cima?
O futuro me assombra, o futuro é que nem minha sombra
Por mais que eu tente, ele tá sempre na frente
Na próxima esquina ele me tromba
Já disse um amigo, não mexa com o futuro
Pois quando ele acordar, quem vai dormir é seu presente
Eu tenho em mente que a jornada da vida é feita sozinha
E que no fim das contas a responsa é só minha
E cada verso que eu rabisco é minha vida em risco
Por isso que eu não desperdiço uma só linha
Brazza, ADL, Rincon, Leal e Shomon, no mesmo som
É tipo juntar Curry, Durant e LeBron
O flow do BIG num verso do Gil Scott-Heron
Áries e Poseidon, Poetas da Babylon
Cavaleiros do Zodíaco vindo pra acabar com MC Pokémon
[Verso 4: Lord]
Meu manos me chamaram pra gravar um som
Pra mim, fazer um som é como a droga crack
Te leva ao prazer ou à destruição
Por isso eu penso antes de escrever minha parte
Favela tá lotada de notícia ruim
O tráfico seduz, matou Jefinho, prendeu Junin'
As armas fizeram chorar tia Cláudia
E quem não conhece a causa
Leva o conselho pra casa, parcerin'
Bebidas fizeram sangrar mulheres
Que não eram como vocês querem
Julgadas pelo o que vestem
E ainda que não deixem que elas falem
""Por elas no lugar delas""
O lugar delas são elas que sabem
O dele hoje é na laje, tá plantando atividade
Dez de idade ele é adulto, a mãe dele tá no culto
Pai dele em algum lugar do mundo
Ele quer que se foda, aperta o fumo
Um pivete, uma responsa e tu velho não toma um rumo
Então meus manos me chamaram pra gravar um som
Mas pra mim, gravar um som é como um tiroteio
Quem não sabe o que falar, acerta um inocente
Mas quem sabe acerta o coco desses verme em cheio

[Verso 5: Leal]
Linhas abrigam o castigo, eu reflito sobre o momento
Agora fazer merda é fácil, né? Só arrumar argumento
Eu quase vomito vendo falsidade
Amargurado com os dentes a mostra
Olha pro lado, não olha no olho
Sorri, só que fala quando eu viro as costas
A garrafa cheia, igual peito de lágrima
Carteira vazia, normal, até porque a mente também tava
Mas hoje não trava em qualquer lugar
E sempre vai ser hino
Pros Jim Carrey do rap ter um dia de Al Pacino
Pelo ensino estadual igual dos boy, é isso memo
Porque não estuda, e também lava prato
E pro favelado poder sem dinheiro
As damas primeiro, junto com as cria
O segredo da vida é não viver com medo
Cê não sabia? Conselho de amigo
Mente vazia, oficina é o governo
Dívida fora é um clássico e adora sumir com imposto
E te faz sentir o máximo de vergonha no rosto
Desequilíbrio social, normal, acompanho de perto
Se for Marinho, seja Eduardo e não o bosta do Roberto
Faz Criança Esperança e patrocina assassinato
Onde ele pôs a mão, corrupção virou um fato
Manipula a política, até compra mandato
Vaio o R e fala ""memo"", e pau no cu se é desacato
Seja o que você quiser não importa onde
Só saber chegar, antes de falar
Eu tive que ouvir, pode suplicar
Tudo acontece quando tem que acontecer

[Verso 6: DK]
Eu sou ""DK-47"" a 700 por minuto
Eu ""DKpito"" os inimigo e faço eles de adubo
Nossa tropa, vagabundo, trabalha com papo reto
E quando o assunto é mancada, eu prefiro ser analfabeto
Aqui o certo é o certo, o errado é o errado
O homem pode ter dois carros, mas não pode ter dois papo
Mano a mano é esporte, na favela é liberado
Agora dá última forma já é outro desenrolado
Esses guardinha são infeliz, nunca sabem o que diz
Nunca vi bom jogador trocar camisa com juiz
É porque os brabo tem nome e apesar de não ter pai
Nosso bonde é pesado e vai trocar até o fim
Caí na selva pivete, eu e Deus e um canivete
Matei os bicho, fiz churrasco, andei de casacos de pele
Não trava nem super-aquece, minha caneta fede a morte
Por isso tão me chamando de ""DK-47""

Unstable,rap,Smooth Brained MOFO,16.0,"Hook- Walking around with the books in my hand, had a nice trip now I’m falling where I stand


Verse 1- Now all alone, in a world of my own, a rush of adrenaline, a feminine man, callin’ me nothin but I’m mentally retarded, but they don’t understand that my brain had farted, before all of this had ever even started


Hook- Walking around with the books in my hand, had a nice trip now I’m falling where I stand. (Yah) * Chorus - I wake up everyday, don’t know what to say, it’s so hard to think, I’ve dropped, I’m cloudy minded, whatever I say I know I will find it. The medicine, my regimen, I say I don’t mind it. I’m troubled, I’ve struggled, I’m lost in my own thoughts, this battle on the daily, is no longer what I have fought


Verse 2- A cause to what we pause, to redetermine a mind that redefined the purpose of all our lives. A perspective, be reflective, of the thought to what we’re taught. For those who believe that the mentally disabled are nothing but mistakes that all parents want to remake, you be lookin through the eyes of them old guys, who do be takin, they be breaking, helpless kids of the unexpected the true neglected, all because there heads gone wild


Hook- Walking around with the books in my hand, had a nice trip now I’m falling where I stand.

The medicine, my regimen, I say I don’t mind it. I’m troubled, I’ve struggled, I’m lost in my own thoughts, this battle on the daily, is no longer what I have fought


Middle 8/ Bridge - The mr meseeks the he seeks all existence is pain. I’ll show you nothing but persistence til the thing called fame. Yeah, having it tough, been growing up rough, no mama, no father shaping me nuff. Been livin alone, calling my own, shots connectin them dots, piecing the puzzle gettin in trouble, all because I’m living a lot, think like a bot, the brain be chuggin away like a train, hitting the rain, all to reframe a mind of a devil who's having it lame

Verse 3- This daily bullying, I can’t hold it in, so I’m giving in, that’s it I’ve had enough, I can’t think straight, why is it so tough, life you turn around, you fuck me over, you make me weak it’s hard to show her, my feelings that I’m feeling, I can’t breathe it’s so hard to deal with. That’s it I’ve had enough I’m ending, no bother spending, all this time wasting another breath, while I’d be better down here with death

Leaving destruction within my wake
Your souls mother fuckin’ break
And your lives I will fucking take

Soul reaping to all that is near
Leading me to this empty fear
Standing alone, death beside me
The destruction of humanity

The ashes rain like tears of blood, tears of blood
Falling from the sky
And why does everything we hold near die?
Ripping apart all your lies

Within my wake

Running from the beaten path
Fearing to feel heavens wrath
Thе angel descends; his scythе is drenched
From all the bodies that fill this trench
All the blood of man
Spread across the wing span
Of the angel that protects this land
The chaos is done and returns to sand

The ashes rain like tears of blood, tears of blood
Falling from the sky

¡Esa es mi cumbia!

Por tu amor he soportado, una y 1000 humillaciones
Es tan claro que te gusta jugar con mis ilusiones
Porque cuando se te antoja rompes y vuelves conmigo
Cada vez es más frecuente que me duerma mal herido

Eres mi talón de Aquiles, mi punto más vulnerable
Con un beso intentas siempre que yo quiera reclamarte
Porque un día me das gloria al jurarme amor eterno
Pero al otro se te olvida y me mandas al infierno

Quisiera tener poderes y memoria de teflón
Para que no se me peguen los recuerdos de este amor
Ser un muñeco de trapo que tenga ojos de botones
Para no ver tu sonrisa y no sentir tus emociones
Desafortunadamente, imposible es que no duela
Despertar de un cuento de hadas y llorar al darme cuenta
Que amo a un maniquí que tiene sentimientos de cartón
Y es que Dios cuando te hizo cometió un pequeño error
No te puso un corazón

Still I feel the hate that they send to me, but I ain’t got no time for no enemy
I keep it real ntwana fuck a Frienemy, I'm so sick of the fact that they fake to me
And my music is my only remedy, I couldn’t give a shit if they feelin' me
Still I'm grateful to those who stay real to me, and I pray to God he stay beside of me
I get it on like Marvin Gay, keep the hustle going on everyday
Get that bread like it’s just another day, nizogcwala nje nge bank on pay day
I keep my shit going on every day, like a battery I'm ever ready
I'm in my zone feelin' some type of way, now watch me whip these niggas no Nae Nae… hey

This liquor a friend of me
My ego my enemy, but you pull me back
Those photos you sending me
I'm weak, but I let it be
Can't tell if you're lovin' me, but you do know Jack
And I think that I'll never know

So we look kind of weird to you
Well, how do you look to me?

Old Feeling,pop,Todd Sharpville,23.0,"I get this old, old feeling
When I dream of you at night
Get this old, old feeling
When nothing's going right

Every familiar song reminds me of those days when things were fine
But rose tinted glass can fast turn into blue
'Cause you're long gone and I shouldn't be in love with you

It's just a false remembrance
Of how it all went down
When occasionally I only see good times

The pain you caused & left behind
Is but a shadow in my mind
And what's left to reminisce is all but true
While you're long gone & I shouldn't be in love with you

I do believe my heart has a sense of humor
That's darker than the blackest night
It's still playing games with the state of my emotions
Making every wrong somehow feel so right
Can't shake that old, old feeling
It still keeps me hanging on
When will that old, old feeling
Finally move on?

The fact you left me is old news, guess it ain't nothing but the blues
There'll be other hands to play and more to lose
But you're long gone and for a moment, I'm still in love with you
Yeah, you're long gone and I shouldn't be in love with you",0.6098374370485544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scar Sculpture,pop,Snowgoons,242.0,"[Featuring: Virtuoso, Young Haze]

[Verse 1: Virtuoso]
Virtuoso I rock the planet like the Mars Rover
Slash your body, turn it to a scar sculpture, brimstone bar sofa
Syllables, unkillable carcass, flow vulture
Swallow your own pistol, the nine milly throat culture
You bitches got no culture, no future
I'm a do you a favour and execute you losers
Using German Lugers, future of the human race
Snowgoons facing impending doom
Take all of your greatest minds in line and send them to the moon
To be colonized, bringing model fly bitches to sodomize
The rest of you sorry souls are lobotomized
God is alive, transcending reality's fabric
I twist it and bend it, I'm tripping balls like Hendrix
You're useless like an appendix, my crew is more nuts than ten dicks
Suspended in time like a pendulum
I'm redefining my paradigm to include a pair of dimes at all times
Put heaters to [? ] nines
The Karlheinz verdict is guilty of war crimes
No more nice guy, clips that I spit off kill
Lyrically ruthless, my regiments like Kim Jong Il
Spill Henny with no chaser, y'all like grape juice in sippy cups
Twisting up some piff to puff laying back while my dick gets sucked
I'm mister what the fuck I wanna do I do it
Leave you crew and clique spayed and neutered
Laying, losing blood, and puking
Hanging on to life by two strands, you can do one of two things
Get pushed down the mountain or kiss the crown, it's the new king
[Verse 2: Young Haze]
Who but me iller? Silverback Gorilla
You a dead man walking like Mike Jack in Thriller
To body another rapper, my pleasure
Don't rate him with me nigga, his style just don't measure
Came to the conclusion that hip hop's mine
[? ] you know the ziplock kind
Yo I had to play the field, had to pitch that dime
Assault with a deadly weapon? Yeah, I did that crime
So if you think something's sweet come try me
I'm a let your face ride the shotty, it'll be a body
And I put in knife work, he a bitch, get him a tight skirt
I let loose until the clock jerk
I been riding around since I was a day tall
Coward niggas run, real niggas play ball

Fuck with either one, you online like Protools, nigga",0.493482006713748,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It hurt to see my idol fall
But I know I’m bound to ball
Hurt to see my idol die
Now I got tears in my eyes
For a week I cried
Do not mention
Desmond
He saved my life
I was under pressure
Had thoughts of suicide
But he showed the better side
He showed smash streams
Last thing I thought about was death
I was laughing with the rest
I found a community
Rattpack it got thru to me

Fuck the green
Chase your dreams
Fuck the mainstream
Now he all up it in
He think that he a Benz he a civic

All you do is waste time
Coasting off the bass line
All you spit is fake lines
You don’t even make time
You don’t even try

Made it back home with the whole thing takedown

Quarter million down in Cape Town, surprised I ain’t face trial
I always get it off of breakdowns

This shit was rough, I had to make tough decisions
Thinking back over ties that I cut with sis
So much powder on the counter, I had to dust the kitchen
And the prices so low, they think the plug a midget
I ain’t stumble over luck and get it, it ain’t that
You know I put mine up, they go to clubs and spend it
Run that flick shit, I was still juggling business
In the trap, me and Jay Rock bagging bundles in it
Said he beat me out some paper, then you know he a liar, nigga
I ain’t rolled with 8’s since Kobe retired
Know some niggas who sold coke then spoke on the wire
Over dough, I sat in the fed hole as a minor, uh
My first brick how I got my bounce
But I made more ounce by ounce, hand to hand, going out my house
Only real shit come out my mouth
Thumbing through this bread and I’ll put it on your head ‘fore I stop my count
The block will erupt if buy watches [?]
We here at Matties with a brick of raw locked in the trunk
Twenty-five shots get you stopped in your truck
And I heard the word is the shooter hopped in with us

I turn your block to a new set if I don’t tell him cool that
You fuck niggas ain’t give me no advice I could use yet
Who set the table with 8-balls like a pool set
Was stressing true, yes, now it’s VS’s on my crew neck
The strap mine, the homie just riding and tote it for me, ha
And he down to line you over this money
The plug need me to get rid of it, you know it’s ugly
Got my price cheap as the niggas who sold it to me
And their diamonds don’t hit like this, their whips not fast enough
Bring that bitch around again and I’ma end up tagging her

Friendship,misc,Ralph Waldo Emerson,1069.0,"FRIENDSHIP

A ruddy drop of manly blood
The surging sea outweighs,
The world uncertain comes and goes,
The lover rooted stays.
I fancied he was fled,
And, after many a year,
Glowed unexhausted kindliness
Like daily sunrise there.
My careful heart was free again, —
O friend, my bosom said,
Through thee alone the sky is arched,
Through thee the rose is red,
All things through thee take nobler form,
And look beyond the earth,
And is the mill–round of our fate
A sun–path in thy worth.
Me too thy nobleness has taught
To master my despair;
The fountains of my hidden life
Are through thy friendship fair.
We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken. Maugre all the selfishness that chills like east winds the world, the whole human family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether. How many persons we meet in houses, whom we scarcely speak to, whom yet we honor, and who honor us! How many we see in the street, or sit with in church, whom, though silently, we warmly rejoice to be with! Read the language of these wandering eye–beams. The heart knoweth.

The effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain cordial exhilaration. In poetry, and in common speech, the emotions of benevolence and complacency which are felt towards others are likened to the material effects of fire; so swift, or much more swift, more active, more cheering, are these fine inward irradiations. From the highest degree of passionate love, to the lowest degree of good–will, they make the sweetness of life.

Our intellectual and active powers increase with our affection. The scholar sits down to write, and all his years of meditation do not furnish him with one good thought or happy expression; but it is necessary to write a letter to a friend, — and, forthwith, troops of gentle thoughts invest themselves, on every hand, with chosen words. See, in any house where virtue and self–respect abide, the palpitation which the approach of a stranger causes. A commended stranger is expected and announced, and an uneasiness betwixt pleasure and pain invades all the hearts of a household. His arrival almost brings fear to the good hearts that would welcome him. The house is dusted, all things fly into their places, the old coat is exchanged for the new, and they must get up a dinner if they can. Of a commended stranger, only the good report is told by others, only the good and new is heard by us. He stands to us for humanity. He is what we wish. Having imagined and invested him, we ask how we should stand related in conversation and action with such a man, and are uneasy with fear. The same idea exalts conversation with him. We talk better than we are wont. We have the nimblest fancy, a richer memory, and our dumb devil has taken leave for the time. For long hours we can continue a series of sincere, graceful, rich communications, drawn from the oldest, secretest experience, so that they who sit by, of our own kinsfolk and acquaintance, shall feel a lively surprise at our unusual powers. But as soon as the stranger begins to intrude his partialities, his definitions, his defects, into the conversation, it is all over. He has heard the first, the last and best he will ever hear from us. He is no stranger now. Vulgarity, ignorance, misapprehension are old acquaintances. Now, when he comes, he may get the order, the dress, and the dinner, — but the throbbing of the heart, and the communications of the soul, no more.

What is so pleasant as these jets of affection which make a young world for me again? What so delicious as a just and firm encounter of two, in a thought, in a feeling? How beautiful, on their approach to this beating heart, the steps and forms of the gifted and the true! The moment we indulge our affections, the earth is metamorphosed; there is no winter, and no night; all tragedies, all ennuis, vanish, — all duties even; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but the forms all radiant of beloved persons. Let the soul be assured that somewhere in the universe it should rejoin its friend, and it would be content and cheerful alone for a thousand years.

I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old and the new. Shall I not call God the Beautiful, who daily showeth himself so to me in his gifts? I chide society, I embrace solitude, and yet I am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise, the lovely, and the noble–minded, as from time to time they pass my gate. Who hears me, who understands me, becomes mine, — a possession for all time. Nor is nature so poor but she gives me this joy several times, and thus we weave social threads of our own, a new web of relations; and, as many thoughts in succession substantiate themselves, we shall by and by stand in a new world of our own creation, and no longer strangers and pilgrims in a traditionary globe. My friends have come to me unsought. The great God gave them to me. By oldest right, by the divine affinity of virtue with itself, I find them, or rather not I, but the Deity in me and in them derides and cancels the thick walls of individual character, relation, age, sex, circumstance, at which he usually connives, and now makes many one. High thanks I owe you, excellent lovers, who carry out the world for me to new and noble depths, and enlarge the meaning of all my thoughts. These are new poetry of the first Bard, — poetry without stop, — hymn, ode, and epic, poetry still flowing, Apollo and the Muses chanting still. Will these, too, separate themselves from me again, or some of them? I know not, but I fear it not; for my relation to them is so pure, that we hold by simple affinity, and the Genius of my life being thus social, the same affinity will exert its energy on whomsoever is as noble as these men and women, wherever I may be.

I confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point. It is almost dangerous to me to “crush the sweet poison of misused wine” of the affections. A new person is to me a great event, and hinders me from sleep. I have often had fine fancies about persons which have given me delicious hours; but the joy ends in the day; it yields no fruit. Thought is not born of it; my action is very little modified. I must feel pride in my friend’s accomplishments as if they were mine, — and a property in his virtues. I feel as warmly when he is praised, as the lover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden. We over–estimate the conscience of our friend. His goodness seems better than our goodness, his nature finer, his temptations less. Every thing that is his, — his name, his form, his dress, books, and instruments, — fancy enhances. Our own thought sounds new and larger from his mouth.

Yet the systole and diastole of the heart are not without their analogy in the ebb and flow of love. Friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed. The lover, beholding his maiden, half knows that she is not verily that which he worships; and in the golden hour of friendship, we are surprised with shades of suspicion and unbelief. We doubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which he shines, and afterwards worship the form to which we have ascribed this divine inhabitation. In strictness, the soul does not respect men as it respects itself. In strict science all persons underlie the same condition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to cool our love by mining for the metaphysical foundation of this Elysian temple? Shall I not be as real as the things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know them for what they are. Their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance, though it needs finer organs for its apprehension. The root of the plant is not unsightly to science, though for chaplets and festoons we cut the stem short. And I must hazard the production of the bald fact amidst these pleasing reveries, though it should prove an Egyptian skull at our banquet. A man who stands united with his thought conceives magnificently of himself. He is conscious of a universal success, even though bought by uniform particular failures. No advantages, no powers, no gold or force, can be any match for him. I cannot choose but rely on my own poverty more than on your wealth. I cannot make your consciousness tantamount to mine. Only the star dazzles; the planet has a faint, moon–like ray. I hear what you say of the admirable parts and tried temper of the party you praise, but I see well that for all his purple cloaks I shall not like him, unless he is at last a poor Greek like me. I cannot deny it, O friend, that the vast shadow of the Phenomenal includes thee also in its pied and painted immensity, — thee, also, compared with whom all else is shadow. Thou art not Being, as Truth is, as Justice is, — thou art not my soul, but a picture and effigy of that. Thou hast come to me lately, and already thou art seizing thy hat and cloak. Is it not that the soul puts forth friends as the tree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the germination of new buds, extrudes the old leaf? The law of nature is alternation for evermore. Each electrical state superinduces the opposite. The soul environs itself with friends, that it may enter into a grander self–acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a season, that it may exalt its conversation or society. This method betrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations. The instinct of affection revives the hope of union with our mates, and the returning sense of insulation recalls us from the chase. Thus every man passes his life in the search after friendship, and if he should record his true sentiment, he might write a letter like this to each new candidate for his love.

DEAR FRIEND: —

If I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with thine, I should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings and goings. I am not very wise; my moods are quite attainable; and I respect thy genius; it is to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare I not presume in thee a perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me a delicious torment. Thine ever, or never.

Yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity, and not for life. They are not to be indulged. This is to weave cobweb, and not cloth. Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions, because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams, instead of the tough fibre of the human heart. The laws of friendship are austere and eternal, of one web with the laws of nature and of morals. But we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden sweetness. We snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden of God, which many summers and many winters must ripen. We seek our friend not sacredly, but with an adulterate passion which would appropriate him to ourselves. In vain. We are armed all over with subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as we meet, begin to play, and translate all poetry into stale prose. Almost all people descend to meet. All association must be a compromise, and, what is worst, the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other. What a perpetual disappointment is actual society, even of the virtuous and gifted! After interviews have been compassed with long foresight, we must be tormented presently by baffled blows, by sudden, unseasonable apathies, by epilepsies of wit and of animal spirits, in the heyday of friendship and thought. Our faculties do not play us true, and both parties are relieved by solitude.

I ought to be equal to every relation. It makes no difference how many friends I have, and what content I can find in conversing with each, if there be one to whom I am not equal. If I have shrunk unequal from one contest, the joy I find in all the rest becomes mean and cowardly. I should hate myself, if then I made my other friends my asylum.

“The valiant warrior famoused for fight,
After a hundred victories, once foiled,
Is from the book of honor razed quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled.”
Our impatience is thus sharply rebuked. Bashfulness and apathy are a tough husk, in which a delicate organization is protected from premature ripening. It would be lost if it knew itself before any of the best souls were yet ripe enough to know and own it. Respect the naturlangsamkeit which hardens the ruby in a million years, and works in duration, in which Alps and Andes come and go as rainbows. The good spirit of our life has no heaven which is the price of rashness. Love, which is the essence of God, is not for levity, but for the total worth of man. Let us not have this childish luxury in our regards, but the austerest worth; let us approach our friend with an audacious trust in the truth of his heart, in the breadth, impossible to be overturned, of his foundations.
The attractions of this subject are not to be resisted, and I leave, for the time, all account of subordinate social benefit, to speak of that select and sacred relation which is a kind of absolute, and which even leaves the language of love suspicious and common, so much is this purer, and nothing is so much divine.

I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest courage. When they are real, they are not glass threads or frostwork, but the solidest thing we know. For now, after so many ages of experience, what do we know of nature, or of ourselves? Not one step has man taken toward the solution of the problem of his destiny. In one condemnation of folly stand the whole universe of men. But the sweet sincerity of joy and peace, which I draw from this alliance with my brother’s soul, is the nut itself, whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and shell. Happy is the house that shelters a friend! It might well be built, like a festal bower or arch, to entertain him a single day. Happier, if he know the solemnity of that relation, and honor its law! He who offers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up, like an Olympian, to the great games, where the first–born of the world are the competitors. He proposes himself for contests where Time, Want, Danger, are in the lists, and he alone is victor who has truth enough in his constitution to preserve the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and tear of all these. The gifts of fortune may be present or absent, but all the speed in that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness, and the contempt of trifles. There are two elements that go to the composition of friendship, each so sovereign that I can detect no superiority in either, no reason why either should be first named. One is Truth. A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think aloud. I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal, that I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness with which one chemical atom meets another. Sincerity is the luxury allowed, like diadems and authority, only to the highest rank, that being permitted to speak truth, as having none above it to court or conform unto. Every man alone is sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins. We parry and fend the approach of our fellow–man by compliments, by gossip, by amusements, by affairs. We cover up our thought from him under a hundred folds. I knew a man, who, under a certain religious frenzy, cast off this drapery, and, omitting all compliment and commonplace, spoke to the conscience of every person he encountered, and that with great insight and beauty. At first he was resisted, and all men agreed he was mad. But persisting, as indeed he could not help doing, for some time in this course, he attained to the advantage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him. No man would think of speaking falsely with him, or of putting him off with any chat of markets or reading–rooms. But every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the like plaindealing, and what love of nature, what poetry, what symbol of truth he had, he did certainly show him. But to most of us society shows not its face and eye, but its side and its back. To stand in true relations with men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not? We can seldom go erect. Almost every man we meet requires some civility, — requires to be humored; he has some fame, some talent, some whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be questioned, and which spoils all conversation with him. But a friend is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity, but me. My friend gives me entertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part. A friend, therefore, is a sort of paradox in nature. I who alone am, I who see nothing in nature whose existence I can affirm with equal evidence to my own, behold now the semblance of my being, in all its height, variety, and curiosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so that a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.

The other element of friendship is tenderness. We are holden to men by every sort of tie, by blood, by pride, by fear, by hope, by lucre, by lust, by hate, by admiration, by every circumstance and badge and trifle, but we can scarce believe that so much character can subsist in another as to draw us by love. Can another be so blessed, and we so pure, that we can offer him tenderness? When a man becomes dear to me, I have touched the goal of fortune. I find very little written directly to the heart of this matter in books. And yet I have one text which I cannot choose but remember. My author says, — “I offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose I effectually am, and tender myself least to him to whom I am the most devoted.” I wish that friendship should have feet, as well as eyes and eloquence. It must plant itself on the ground, before it vaults over the moon. I wish it to be a little of a citizen, before it is quite a cherub. We chide the citizen because he makes love a commodity. It is an exchange of gifts, of useful loans; it is good neighbourhood; it watches with the sick; it holds the pall at the funeral; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of the relation. But though we cannot find the god under this disguise of a sutler, yet, on the other hand, we cannot forgive the poet if he spins his thread too fine, and does not substantiate his romance by the municipal virtues of justice, punctuality, fidelity, and pity. I hate the prostitution of the name of friendship to signify modish and worldly alliances. I much prefer the company of ploughboys and tin–peddlers, to the silken and perfumed amity which celebrates its days of encounter by a frivolous display, by rides in a curricle, and dinners at the best taverns. The end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely that can be joined; more strict than any of which we have experience. It is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life and death. It is fit for serene days, and graceful gifts, and country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty, and persecution. It keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the trances of religion. We are to dignify to each other the daily needs and offices of man’s life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom, and unity. It should never fall into something usual and settled, but should be alert and inventive, and add rhyme and reason to what was drudgery.

Friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each so well tempered and so happily adapted, and withal so circumstanced, (for even in that particular, a poet says, love demands that the parties be altogether paired,) that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured. It cannot subsist in its perfection, say some of those who are learned in this warm lore of the heart, betwixt more than two. I am not quite so strict in my terms, perhaps because I have never known so high a fellowship as others. I please my imagination more with a circle of godlike men and women variously related to each other, and between whom subsists a lofty intelligence. But I find this law of one to one peremptory for conversation, which is the practice and consummation of friendship. Do not mix waters too much. The best mix as ill as good and bad. You shall have very useful and cheering discourse at several times with two several men, but let all three of you come together, and you shall not have one new and hearty word. Two may talk and one may hear, but three cannot take part in a conversation of the most sincere and searching sort. In good company there is never such discourse between two, across the table, as takes place when you leave them alone. In good company, the individuals merge their egotism into a social soul exactly co–extensive with the several consciousnesses there present. No partialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother to sister, of wife to husband, are there pertinent, but quite otherwise. Only he may then speak who can sail on the common thought of the party, and not poorly limited to his own. Now this convention, which good sense demands, destroys the high freedom of great conversation, which requires an absolute running of two souls into one.

No two men but, being left alone with each other, enter into simpler relations. Yet it is affinity that determines which two shall converse. Unrelated men give little joy to each other; will never suspect the latent powers of each. We talk sometimes of a great talent for conversation, as if it were a permanent property in some individuals. Conversation is an evanescent relation, — no more. A man is reputed to have thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all that, say a word to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with as much reason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade. In the sun it will mark the hour. Among those who enjoy his thought, he will regain his tongue.

Friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and unlikeness, that piques each with the presence of power and of consent in the other party. Let me be alone to the end of the world, rather than that my friend should overstep, by a word or a look, his real sympathy. I am equally balked by antagonism and by compliance. Let him not cease an instant to be himself. The only joy I have in his being mine, is that the not mine is mine. I hate, where I looked for a manly furtherance, or at least a manly resistance, to find a mush of concession. Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his echo. The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it. That high office requires great and sublime parts. There must be very two, before there can be very one. Let it be an alliance of two large, formidable natures, mutually beheld, mutually feared, before yet they recognize the deep identity which beneath these disparities unites them.

He only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who is sure that greatness and goodness are always economy; who is not swift to intermeddle with his fortunes. Let him not intermeddle with this. Leave to the diamond its ages to grow, nor expect to accelerate the births of the eternal. Friendship demands a religious treatment. We talk of choosing our friends, but friends are self–elected. Reverence is a great part of it. Treat your friend as a spectacle. Of course he has merits that are not yours, and that you cannot honor, if you must needs hold him close to your person. Stand aside; give those merits room; let them mount and expand. Are you the friend of your friend’s buttons, or of his thought? To a great heart he will still be a stranger in a thousand particulars, that he may come near in the holiest ground. Leave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as property, and to suck a short and all–confounding pleasure, instead of the noblest benefit.

Let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation. Why should we desecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them? Why insist on rash personal relations with your friend? Why go to his house, or know his mother and brother and sisters? Why be visited by him at your own? Are these things material to our covenant? Leave this touching and clawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message, a thought, a sincerity, a glance from him, I want, but not news, nor pottage. I can get politics, and chat, and neighbourly conveniences from cheaper companions. Should not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure, universal, and great as nature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is profane in comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon, or that clump of waving grass that divides the brook? Let us not vilify, but raise it to that standard. That great, defying eye, that scornful beauty of his mien and action, do not pique yourself on reducing, but rather fortify and enhance. Worship his superiorities; wish him not less by a thought, but hoard and tell them all. Guard him as thy counterpart. Let him be to thee for ever a sort of beautiful enemy, untamable, devoutly revered, and not a trivial conveniency to be soon outgrown and cast aside. The hues of the opal, the light of the diamond, are not to be seen, if the eye is too near. To my friend I write a letter, and from him I receive a letter. That seems to you a little. It suffices me. It is a spiritual gift worthy of him to give, and of me to receive. It profanes nobody. In these warm lines the heart will trust itself, as it will not to the tongue, and pour out the prophecy of a godlier existence than all the annals of heroism have yet made good.

Respect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not to prejudice its perfect flower by your impatience for its opening. We must be our own before we can be another’s. There is at least this satisfaction in crime, according to the Latin proverb; — you can speak to your accomplice on even terms. Crimen quos inquinat, aequat. To those whom we admire and love, at first we cannot. Yet the least defect of self–possession vitiates, in my judgment, the entire relation. There can never be deep peace between two spirits, never mutual respect, until, in their dialogue, each stands for the whole world.

What is so great as friendship, let us carry with what grandeur of spirit we can. Let us be silent, — so we may hear the whisper of the gods. Let us not interfere. Who set you to cast about what you should say to the select souls, or how to say any thing to such? No matter how ingenious, no matter how graceful and bland. There are innumerable degrees of folly and wisdom, and for you to say aught is to be frivolous. Wait, and thy heart shall speak. Wait until the necessary and everlasting overpowers you, until day and night avail themselves of your lips. The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend is to be one. You shall not come nearer a man by getting into his house. If unlike, his soul only flees the faster from you, and you shall never catch a true glance of his eye. We see the noble afar off, and they repel us; why should we intrude? Late, — very late, — we perceive that no arrangements, no introductions, no consuetudes or habits of society, would be of any avail to establish us in such relations with them as we desire, — but solely the uprise of nature in us to the same degree it is in them; then shall we meet as water with water; and if we should not meet them then, we shall not want them, for we are already they. In the last analysis, love is only the reflection of a man’s own worthiness from other men. Men have sometimes exchanged names with their friends, as if they would signify that in their friend each loved his own soul.

The higher the style we demand of friendship, of course the less easy to establish it with flesh and blood. We walk alone in the world. Friends, such as we desire, are dreams and fables. But a sublime hope cheers ever the faithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of the universal power, souls are now acting, enduring, and daring, which can love us, and which we can love. We may congratulate ourselves that the period of nonage, of follies, of blunders, and of shame, is passed in solitude, and when we are finished men, we shall grasp heroic hands in heroic hands. Only be admonished by what you already see, not to strike leagues of friendship with cheap persons, where no friendship can be. Our impatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no God attends. By persisting in your path, though you forfeit the little you gain the great. You demonstrate yourself, so as to put yourself out of the reach of false relations, and you draw to you the first–born of the world, — those rare pilgrims whereof only one or two wander in nature at once, and before whom the vulgar great show as spectres and shadows merely.

It is foolish to be afraid of making our ties too spiritual, as if so we could lose any genuine love. Whatever correction of our popular views we make from insight, nature will be sure to bear us out in, and though it seem to rob us of some joy, will repay us with a greater. Let us feel, if we will, the absolute insulation of man. We are sure that we have all in us. We go to Europe, or we pursue persons, or we read books, in the instinctive faith that these will call it out and reveal us to ourselves. Beggars all. The persons are such as we; the Europe an old faded garment of dead persons; the books their ghosts. Let us drop this idolatry. Let us give over this mendicancy. Let us even bid our dearest friends farewell, and defy them, saying, ‘Who are you? Unhand me: I will be dependent no more.’ Ah! seest thou not, O brother, that thus we part only to meet again on a higher platform, and only be more each other’s, because we are more our own? A friend is Janus–faced: he looks to the past and the future. He is the child of all my foregoing hours, the prophet of those to come, and the harbinger of a greater friend.

I do then with my friends as I do with my books. I would have them where I can find them, but I seldom use them. We must have society on our own terms, and admit or exclude it on the slightest cause. I cannot afford to speak much with my friend. If he is great, he makes me so great that I cannot descend to converse. In the great days, presentiments hover before me in the firmament. I ought then to dedicate myself to them. I go in that I may seize them, I go out that I may seize them. I fear only that I may lose them receding into the sky in which now they are only a patch of brighter light. Then, though I prize my friends, I cannot afford to talk with them and study their visions, lest I lose my own. It would indeed give me a certain household joy to quit this lofty seeking, this spiritual astronomy, or search of stars, and come down to warm sympathies with you; but then I know well I shall mourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods. It is true, next week I shall have languid moods, when I can well afford to occupy myself with foreign objects; then I shall regret the lost literature of your mind, and wish you were by my side again. But if you come, perhaps you will fill my mind only with new visions, not with yourself but with your lustres, and I shall not be able any more than now to converse with you. So I will owe to my friends this evanescent intercourse. I will receive from them, not what they have, but what they are. They shall give me that which properly they cannot give, but which emanates from them. But they shall not hold me by any relations less subtile and pure. We will meet as though we met not, and part as though we parted not.
It has seemed to me lately more possible than I knew, to carry a friendship greatly, on one side, without due correspondence on the other. Why should I cumber myself with regrets that the receiver is not capacious? It never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide and vain into ungrateful space, and only a small part on the reflecting planet. Let your greatness educate the crude and cold companion. If he is unequal, he will presently pass away; but thou art enlarged by thy own shining, and, no longer a mate for frogs and worms, dost soar and burn with the gods of the empyrean. It is thought a disgrace to love unrequited. But the great will see that true love cannot be unrequited. True love transcends the unworthy object, and dwells and broods on the eternal, and when the poor interposed mask crumbles, it is not sad, but feels rid of so much earth, and feels its independency the surer. Yet these things may hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the relation. The essence of friendship is entireness, a total magnanimity and trust. It must not surmise or provide for infirmity. It treats its object as a god, that it may deify both.",0.5934219181034414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

El amor que tanto has dado
Una luz que velará siempre por mi

Un lugar en el que puedan abrazarte
Donde las estrellas puedan enseñarme
Que tu luz sigue brillando en otra parte

Se te puede acabar de repente

Vive y deja una huella gigante en la gente
Como la que tu dejaste sobre mi piel
Aún recuerdo tu llamada para comer
Y es que tu mayor tesoro fuimos nosotros

Its a damn shame

I know three things in my lifetime
Belaganas
Money, bitches and clothes

Start spittin', far ahead of all the fake shit
[?] in the clouds, for a second I need patience
Message getting filed cause I'm sick of spending days around these motherfuckers, thats okay we're sticking to the day shit
[?]
Never was complacent
Fed up with the lack of cheddar, fed up with the basement
[?] ain't a message I been making, used to step all on my name but they left the conversation
I been feeling caged in
Ever since a kid, though
Found my real focus so I had to let my bitch go
Kicked out the house, family broken like some windows
I used to spend the afternoon [?] with my friends though
Dirt, weed and ripped clothes, thats just all the kid know
Skipping school to [?] pressure on the pencil
Now I'm almost famous, I'm just chilling in the limbo
[?] just a motherfuckin' intro
Had to tell 'em

Ahah

This is the rage
Are you ready?
Fuck you

[Verse 2: Belaganas]
Kicked out, you gettin' checked up
Blunt is slick, we pass it like its a test
You talkin' big over text
But asinine in the flesh
I'm masterminding the clique
You passin' by, end up dead
Daddy cry for the kids who colder than this
Coke another mans b'iness, I'll never put my nose in this shit
Who you 'posed to be with
Now I'm closing a fist
Catch a twitter hater, he get dumped to the ocean to swim
Why you postin' this shit
Slug a hoe in the dick
Pablo kinda money, got it all without owning a brick
I'm a made man

Know a [?] plan, I'll go when I'm rich
Took over the whole state, 'finna go flame, get a propane, you don't know pain, know my homies only by code names
I'm lonely solely because no one told me its okay
Codeine crazy, I'll find a home in my own grave

You gotta show me that you not an informant
I call shots like the Glock got a doctors appointment
And I ain't never nervous, dead bodies is a cold foot
Hand on my dick, other hand on the old book
Know that I'm the chief, you need a pass? That's a no look
Maddie said forget about Kareem, that's a no hook
Owe me and this money on your head like you thought about it
Then I'mma take it off his head like he forgot about it
Playing possum never could work, cause playing possum turn to playing ostrich's head in the dirt
New merch, put your favorite rappers head on a shirt
Its Mr. too damn good, bitch, I'm [?]
And if the medics see I tell 'em ""Better let 'em bleed or you gon' get what my hands seein', like leprosy""

Shut up nigga, you ain't up next unless you next to me

To burn the day again
When darkness shows no end
Smile at the saddest times
Weep for a happy life

Eyes fixed on heavens high
I tumble into holes

I follow suit in dreams
Voice of the wind and streams
Wise men have none like mine
I am the fools delight

I beg by the moonlight
The voice never consoles

I wake with mind aflame
My joy and sorrow same
The gray fell all around
A sickness so profound

I've earned this endless night
I've earned this bed of coals

The world's come to a head
The sun and moon are dead
Nothing more here to see
The light gives up
Now it's leaving me

I've made myself a thief
Lived beyond belief
If god's just a jawbone
We're just his crooked, rotten teeth

Like snakes around my ankles
I'll be thankful
I deserve no less
Spend my last days under duress

Down and Out,pop,Hit The Switch,3246.0,"I've been sitting by myself just bumming out
I lost the bright side in the crowd
The more I look the less I've found
And in the deepest dark I see no sign
Of bleeding hearts remain
Within the silence falls her name

When those little limbs got pushed up by the waves
I saw your lifeless body drowned
And that's when I dropped to the ground
And as I cursed those rolling clouds
They thundered back in unison
It shook the words and I felt myself come undone
And there I lie still holding on

The middle of the path
You see my bridge is broken down
And you felt so compelled to stick around
Told me just run into the waves
Just grow your light
Just know your safe
And know you're mine
So when all this fades away
I'll still be waiting for the right time to let go
Because it's everything I know
Maybe I'm a little scared to be alone
Maybe I'm scared to leave
I can't pull the shades from over me

And as I drift away remember
That I tried my best to give
My withered heart still bleeding red

Not knowing anything was wrong

Andando de bar em bar

E ele me contava de sua vida solitária
Errando por às vezes acertar
Todas as derrotas que o velho colecionava
Serviram também para me ensinar

E foi Jack que me disse
""Garoto, não se esconda
A vida é para quem sabe lutar
Um belo par de pernas não traz felicidade
Escolha a que você vai amar
E dela aprenda desde agora a cuidar""


Jack me encarava com muita seriedade
Daquelas que te prende no olhar
Não havia mágoas nem media suas palavras
Falava o que quisesse falar
E ele me dizia com uma voz embriagada
E com um Lucky Strike na mão para fumar
""Rapaz, não seja tolo
O tempo é muito curto
E nessa vida não existe sorte ou azar""

Mas fique livre para acreditar
Nesse pobre homem velho fracassado
Mas saiba que estarei
Sempre do seu lado
Com uma garrafa para te salvar

E foi Jack quem me disse
""Garoto, não se esconda
A vida foi feita para apanhar
A vida é para quem sabe lutar
Um belo par de pernas não traz felicidade
Escolha a que você vai amar""

Insomniaque,rap,Kacem Wapalek,3330.0,"[Couplet]
J'm'en fous, j'fume, je fuis l'ennui et les gendarmes
J'emmerde la norme, je vis la nuit, quand les gens dorment
Aujourd'hui, nous sommes ce genre d'hommes légendaires
Qui, chaque nuit, s'assomment à grands coups de joints d'herbe
On s'ennuie, on s'emmerde, on s'détruit
On s'sent mal : en somme, on n'a pas appris à s'aimer assez
Maintenant, c'est mort, on sait mec, on s'en moque
Ici, seuls les sous manquent, et puis nique sa mère !
Tant qu'on se marre, qu'on s'amuse aux pieds de ces murs
On sait, mec, on n'est pas assez murs
Insomniaques, on fait tout ça parce qu'on s'emmerde
Insomniaques, car c'est ainsi que nous sommes nés...
Ouais, c'est ici que nous sommes nous...
Et dire qu'un flic, en cinq minutes, peut t'accrocher ses menottes
Ça m'énerve de voir tous ces crimes commis : ça sert à rien
À moins d'avoir envie d'finir sa nuit au commissariat
Justement, commence à s'faire tard
J'ai vu des potes s'faire saute et d'autres par terre, des putes s'faire serr'
Des flics partout, et plein d'plaintes pour t'faire taire :
Ils ont même des avions charter pour désinfecter l'secteur
Et, même ici, s'il faut qu't'aies plus d'factures : y'a plus de facteur
Les inspecteurs sont spectateurs
Et, si tu crois qu'on les respecte, t'as tord
Celui qui t'a dit ça s'paye ta tête, espèce d'tapette
J'suis pas d'ta tess', moi, j'te pète ta tête, tapette
Ici, la police est ton adversaire, fais gaffe à pas t'faire serr'
Pour deux fois rien, tu peux t'faire saute
On fourguait des plaques et des blocs
À l'époque, c'était du black, et les potes sortaient des blagues à la BAC
Notre son t'embarque, il tabasse et tourne en boucle, comme la BAC
""Oh handek ! Des decks débarquent là-bas !
Planque la beuh, esquive la BAC ou braque la banque !""
C'est c'que la rue nous dit, j'vais pas t'l'apprendre
La mauvaise pente : tes potes la prennent, tu traînes
L'alcool et le shit te freinent et, un beau jour, les flics te prennent
La ferme ! Il est temps qu't'apprennes
Que tu t'imprègnes du fait que les rues craignent en fait
Paraîtrait qu'traîner trop t'rend trash, mec
Rentre, être entre traîtres t'rend trop triste...

Pretty Boy Floyd,pop,Bob Dylan,2000.0,"If you'll gather 'round me, people
A story, I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife, she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down

Now, he took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name
He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door

Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill

'Twas in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say:

You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief

Well, it's through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen

Well, it's through this world you ramble
It's through this world you roam
You won't never see an outlaw

Perfect Little Heart,pop,Uriah Heep,109.0,"When I think about it
Does anybody win
Taking for yourself and giving nothing
Now that we're apart
I see it wasn't really love
I can ride down the road
And let my soul run free

You may think it over
But no matter what you say
You're talking to yourself
And getting nowhere
There ain't no second chances
No reason to pretend
I'm gonna ride down the road
And let my soul run free

Now that we've grown apart
It seems so very sad
Why did it turn so bad and I remember
You said that all good things
Must surely end
Never mind all the hearts
That lie broken
I know I'll never make
The same mistake again
I doesn' matter what you say

Now I think about it
We all need a little time
'Cause if we ain't got love
We ain't got nothing
The doors are opened wide
On my one and only life
Gonna ride down the road
And let my soul run free

I know I'll never make
The same mistake again
But I will always be your friend

Now that we've grown apart
It seems so very sad
Why did it turn so bad and I remember
And I remember

Rongé je me sens esquinté

Comme Pilate je sens la mise à sac

La peau au contact moins vite se rétracte
Le goût se trahit les couleurs s'assombrissent
Les passions se chapardent dans d'étranges histoires

L'irruption brutale du désir animal
Et le corps trahit cheveux dents un souci

Hahaha
Those who against me, I'm mad
Alright, fuck it

[Verse]
Here's a little riddle that I stole from the Riddler
As you can tell I don't wanna be the Fiddler
Or I'll be a goof like Adam Sandler
The only difference is that I'm the goof who pulls the trigger
What's got a big beard considered a gay queer
Who bodied the biggest retard of the year
Who also did songs with his own brother that can't even rap either?
Is it WWE's Dolph? Gandalf?
A 55 year old wearing sandals? No
His name's Randolph and oh, is he H to the OMO?
A Samoa Joe eating a sloppy joe?
A schnitzel? Or the short and fat version of Big Show?
Listen, Keemstar 2, your rhymes are cheap like Costco
Battling Monroe will cost you
Your channel's like an account on Yahoo with no one to talk to
Better yet, you look like a post mortem version of Post Malone
While eating a snow cone made in Fresno
Slicing your face off and using it as a pizza topping
Smack you up worse than a game of Hockey
Opening my mouth to release the Swarm like Bruce Almighty
Frightening like Slenderman sightings
The Yellow Jacket's senses are sharp like soccer cleats
Don't start with me
One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing like I'm Socrates
I cock it and release, to these haters that cater me with hypocrisy
You ain't stopping me, I'm just implementing my way for Hip-Hop in the streets
Judging by your language, I know you're irate
Dropping bombs on you like an air raid
Buzzing in your ear, like it's an earrape
Stomping on your corpse like I'm aerating
A pure taste of rage when I use vocals
Beer kegs full of red honey for the locals
Hearsay don't make me approachable
Especially when I decide to get social
Grind you into powder, this man's roundhouse kicks ain't shit when the stinger's out
Half the day, he plays his games training about
Thinking that he's retired and relaxing on a safe route
Going big with a low life bank account, while becoming the biggest manwhore in town
I'm so proud, he needs to take his canister full of cancer and sit the fuck down
In his little chair that goes 'round and 'round
Saying he's a killer but he's nice as a flower background
Making me lash out my own clout, unleash my inner Chris Brown
But yo, hominization didn't affect us and we still suppress the nation
Loaded up supplies and we demand for world domination from the infestation

[Verse 1]
Ben nog maar 12 nog veel te leren
Maar ben bijna 13 bestanden importeren
Ben die Zwolse-IJsselmuidenaar heb niks te klagen
Zit ook al op die High School, klas overgeslagen
Ik schrijf geschiedenis, doe het goed
Jij weet niet eens wat je mezelf aanmoet
Het maakt niet uit hoe je bent of wat je hoort
Want als je in jezelf gelooft dan weet ik dat je scoort
Als iedereen gaat haten dan gaan we maar praten
Sta op een berg te skiien om me zorgen kwijt te raken
Iedereen kan een liedje gaan schrijven
Maar weinigen kunnen het overdrijven
Ik voel me spongebob want ik ben aziatisch geel
Het ligt er net weer aan welke spellen ik speel
Ga je voor Fortnite? Dat noemen wij een no feit
Want het is shitty. Hoop dat je dat begrijpt

Niet YouTube famous, en niet Insta famous
Probeer het dan maar in Real Life famous
1983 het is meer 2007
Oh shit, in China een aardbeving het is om te beven
Ik gooi een SO naar mezelf. Want het is werk door mezelf
Zit niet in een duo gooi het niet door de helft
Ik ga wat dingen rappen want ik ben niet origineel
En van die Soundcloud rappers, zijn er veel ste veel

Hou niet zo van die Romeinen hou het maar op Grieken

Toen kwam de boze heks en toen hadden ze spijt

Audiografisch gezien is dat niet mijn ding
Ben dus nu ook een artiest
Leuk, dat je mijn muziek kiest

I'm tired of my mother bustin' ass for other folks
Gettin nowhere fast
While the ho on the corner makin' mo' money sellin ass!
I ain't with this outfit
I gotta make some moves to buy G Jones some nice shit
Before she kill herself, workin on a job all week
That don't even make the fuckin ends meet
I walk down Main Street
Growls in my stomach cause I ain't had nuttin to eat
So how the fuck am I gon' think?
When I'm in a funky sweatsuit and see a bitch in a mink
Her ass is tooken out puttin non-stop
Make the swap and go shop
I said that to say this and every note
I ain't with being broke!

[Bushwick Bill]
I was BORN in a cheap-ass hospital
Brought to 5th Ward, stuffed right in the middle
Of a rock and a hard spot
Before my dad got that ass I was already counted out
What a motherfuckin pity
Momma couldn't afford milk so we had to suck her titty
In the kitchen every night I would see
Rats and roaches eatin better than me
There was no Thanksgiving
They say I'm a fool for thanking God for living
But bein broke ain't no motherfuckin joke
Well out in '91 shit just ain't happenin bro
I never had a God damn thing
Christmas came and went, without a choo-choo train
In the ghettos gifts get stole or bought
Ain't no motherfuckin Santa Claus!

Let the gunshots RANG OUT, blow my God damn BRAINS OUT
If you've been there, you know what I'm talkin about
Gettin over tops my agenda
The easy way out, is to jump out of a window
But that's a dopefiend move gone left
I'll kill you, but not myself!
I tried to do the right things major
But that didn't put no food on the table
Went back to school to get my G.E.D
But who's gonna hire a motherfucker like me?
... McDonald's don't fit
They work you like a dog plus they talk too much shit!
Without them dollar signs
It's like livin and dyin at the same time
And you wonder why a motherfucker sell dope?

Böser Blick vom Beifahrersitz, wenn wir rollen
Promille über zwei, trotzdem kill' ich euch am Mic
Immer was dabei, nur damit du weißt, ihr klein'n Fotzen
Fahrer voll bekifft, Schleudersitz, roter Knopf
Lange Haare wie ein Hippie und der Whiskey on the rocks

Can we stand one and other
Join hands with another
Cold rain I’ve to weather
But I know I’ll be better with my brother by my side
Feel strange found aim
Man I know I’m about to fly
We can do what we want
Imma dream all night
We can shine we can climb
And we’ll be just fine

There will always be the ones who can care
And the ones who goin share
My pain and pride
There will always be the ones who goin tear
And the ones who can’t bear
Our joy and stride
To them other brothers
Sitting over there
Saying kept it real
I know you how you lost your strive
Money you were afraid to fail
In what you held dear
Didn’t fight fear
So be real and don’t sleep at night

Imma let you know imma let you know
When my wide-eyed dreams
Come to life and start to show
I can now see so vividly
If my eyes closed clean
Fore I peak
I’m still a king
Till then we can dance just a little
Romance just a little
This storm is just a drizzle
Imma walk through the tunnel
Looking up to the sky
You can never put me down
With my head held high

We can do what we want
Imma dream all night
We can shine we can climb
And we’ll be just fine

Go!

Outro:
I wish I could stay young forever
Live in my dreams and never get older
I don’t want to be struck by reality
Cause my spirit is infinite
But my youth doesn’t have immunity
I just want you, him, her and them to feel
And I won’t stop till my heart drops
My lungs reek and my fingers bleed
The thoughts of me
Living life full of regrets haunt me
Looking back to a time when I followed my dreams
Before I succumbed to reality
Never let anyone stop you from dreaming
But time is now to make a killing
So wake up or else you’ll be forever sleeping",0.6571652184550961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Upper Heights,rap,Squiggity,23.0,"[Chorus]
I see what the world is like, I think about it every night
Only thing that's on my mind is how I'm gonna get it right
Some things never change but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try
If I had one wish I'd make sure everyone could see the light
I see the light, I know I can share it I just need the time
Anything is possible, believe it, we just need to fight
Dreams over reality, I follow them, I see the signs
I can take you out of sight, bring you to the upper heights

[Verse]
Really on another level thinking how to take you there
Country so corrupt, it's like nobody's even playing fair
Hard to even talk about it, I know there's some problems, man
Seen a lot of things, I done really had some trauma, man
I stay out the way, everyday avoid the drama, man
I don't really talk much, get it from my mama, man
Perpetrating ignorance then you should know you not the man
Teach a kid to be a failure, you should know I'm not a fan
Sharper than razor blade, fresh, it's like I'm tailor-made
I want the children growing up to know they can do anything
Show them that there's more to life
Only they can see the vision
I want them to have the drive
I hope you can complete the mission
Some people just need money, I think I need more than that
I screwed up a lot of times, it's just part of the story, man
Used to live a crazy life, it really isn't for me, man
But I got good homies, aye, that really is important, man
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Take flight, yeah, I'm worried, and they askin' why
Planet going down the drain, rivers running dry
Telling me I'm wrong like you think I'm another guy
A storm is coming and you probably think it's funny, right
Not quite, it's not okay, not even in the slightest
I would turn the whole world to gold if I was Midas
All I got is gold bars, I'm a keep rhyming
Honestly, I'm not even hurt, if it might seem like it
I just know that I can really make a difference
I just think about how much I miss my innocence
Really trying to shuffle up, you could call it that
I done came too far it ain't no fallin' back
See the dream, wake up, then I map it out
Life got me in submission, I'm not tapping out
Live right and you'll be great, that's all you gotta do
Keep your eyes on the prize and ain't no stoppin' you

An arsenal of distraction tactics

Manipulating desire and consensus
They'll use guns, they'll use tear gas
I can hear the sound of boots on broken plate glass
We'll use song as inspiration
To be the rust in their machine is our intention

We've got to set it right, but these devils can't be fought with fists
Dissent, they want to shut it down

Showbiz,rap,Jake Wishard,25.0,"[Intro] Joe Poirier

True, lately I’ve been tempted to
To live a life just like you
To think and feel the way you do
But if I did I’d be a fool

[Verse 1]

All this competition got another artist wishing
That my dad was rich and chilling with a Hollywood position
Just to get someone to listen, hand me diamonds that glisten
Put some money in my pocket, put some food up in the kitchen
So sign me a deal, let my CD go platinum
The gold and the silver you can have em, trash em
Cause I’m moving right past em, I’m in the studio
Cooking up something to outlast em!
That’s why you never see me idle, I’m fighting for my title
It’s a battle for survival, perseverance is vital
Yeah, and I swear it on the bible just like a disciple
Upon my arrival I will battle my rival
Yeah, take the mic and own it, as I face my opponent
I’m in the moment, it bothers you don’t it?
Cause you nervous, unsure of your purpose
Feeling worthless cause you can’t remember you verses!
[Chorus 1]

So if I don’t make it in showbiz!
(Showbiz!)
I just want you all to know this!
(Know this!)
It’s because I was trynna
It’s because I was trynna
(Trynna what!)

So if I don’t make it in showbiz!
(Showbiz!)
I just want you all to know this!

[Verse 2]

If you’re watching I don’t have an option except to get my body rocking
Spit a killer flow to get these peoples jaw’s dropping
Tell the chef that the recipe, I’m fulfilling my destiny
Descending from the heavens I feel angels standing next to me
Connected with The Blessed Be, feel that He is testing but protecting me
From who’s ever trynna get the best of me
But its not going to happen as long as I’m rapping
No longer napping, I’m back in action
Attacking those who be bashing
Even if the odds are against me
Even if my God don’t defend me
Even if my car is on empty
It’s not about being trendy and unfriendly
Driving around in your Beamer, Benz or Bently
Forget all that Jazz I’mma keep it real for the kids
Who actually understand what real hip-hop is
So if I don’t make it in showbiz know this
It’s because I was trynna wake people up from this hypnosis

Tech 9 vs. Jimz,rap,URLtv,577.0,"[Round 1: Jimz]
Now I'm known for callin’ people dirty, but y'all really wanna know what's dirty?
When Mr. Stop Being Dirty...keeps gettin’ done dirty
You motherfuckers
Y'all waited for some sucker shit to happen to book me?
That's how I know this shit ain't about rap
And this is a fact
The irony, I had to get punched just so I could get on SMACK
I guess on the road to be great you hit some bumps and this shit's so sad
Blac Chyna released a sex tape, I never would've thought the top would be this bad
But Lispin' Lenny, tonight I'ma show them the difference between a joke and havin’ comedy
See you always had hate for Jimz, self consciously
Throwin’ dirty on my name constantly
But honestly, what kinda faggot talks shit about you the day after issuing an apology?
You really think I ain't ’bout that life Tech? Until I have you runnin' up the block from me
Red beam on his leg, got him lookin' like he's on house arrest, the walk too far away from the property
I heard all the tough talk you’ve been poppin' you bitch
Don't make me Jimz, Collector, Serius Jones, Hoffa ya shit
It'll be a disaster (Dizaster), once you get a Dose of how tonight, I'm pushin' all the limits
Y'all gon' know I'm vicious
Yeah the microwave's gonna stop, right after I throw it in the bathtub while ya daughter's in it
You and ya mans, look like y'all sell incense, oils, DVD witcha friends
You're a 40 year old wrestling fanatic Tech, give it a rest
But you know what Hakeem? Here's somethin' you'll get
It wouldn't matter if you got on a bulletproof when I start airin' ya Tech
It's Stone Cold in the ring, you'll catch the cans even if you wearin' a vest
But it ain't just me, my whole family's a cold set
That's why I had to call my pops to the battle, he got a legal Beretta M9, he's an old vet'
My sister get type mad and send you some cold texts
My brother? Oh, he got a shotty and it'll expose ya whole chest
We all buckin' slugs, but I'd rather use my mother's snub cause everyone was taught that mama knows (nose) best
You can say what you want about Jimz, but you don't know Jimmy
Any one of my friends ever had a problem they could go get me
But now everyday, everybody movin' so shifty
So I gotta move so swiftly
Hold on, my back is turned, my hands is down, don't hit me
See some days, you gotta go through the hard times in life cause we all sinners
I lost some battles but I was ready to go to war quicker
Even tonight, I grab the gat so fast, I forgot to put the clip in
Now I'm more sicker
But it don't matter, I just creep up low key and pistol whip him 'til I break the hammer like Thor's sister
I'm here to end ya, you ain't my mans bro, you just a bitch I'm here to put my stamp on
Smack tryin' to avenge ya (Avenger) but I'm Thanos
As soon as I start to snap, you and ya mans gone
You can't get me mad, or make Jimmy drop tiers (tears), you ain't Cam'ron
Right now, these bitches got me in every bag; emergency tampons
I didn't wanna battle Tech 9, cause he called Beasley askin' for this
I said, ""I'll do it."" As long as I can control myself from not slappin' you bitch
You're a washed up battle rapper turned analyst
Tryin' to make his way back on the list
But no jokin', every time I watch Champion I think you should stop smokin', the way you stay with all that Blac (Black) on ya lips
Faggot, I don't wanna hear nothin' about fightin', sucker punches or how I got dropped
Cause last night I pulled out the gloves and told you to fight me and ya bitch ass was scared to box
Sucka

Can y'all hear me? Well aight then
You good? Well aight then
S.P.I. two T.A.G.E
Y'all motherfuckers get it right, Wayne A.V.E
Champion!
The government has failed you
See that's a part of what's wrong with you
All of you
You do too much singin' and now enough swingin', a clock's ringin'
You, you, you, now bring it in
They don't hate you cause you're Christian, they hate you cause you're black
They don't hate me cause I'm Muslim, they hate me cause I'm black
They don't hate you cause you rap, they hate you cause you black
They don't it when you lie, they hate it when you tell facts
What you want, the ballot or the bullet?
Get a bullet when I baow it
Two clips (Clipse), one in the Pusha, one is the Malice
I text the squad, ""Meet me outside"", we outsiders
Soon as you step outside, we outline ya
You need self help, a Do It Yourself, a DIY, you'll die tryin' to do it yourself, you need help
Mind strugglin', everybody wanna be a gangsta, my mind's sufferin'
Multi-task, I just left Earth and I'm still here, I'm time jugglin'
Catch 18 from the seven, that a 1-8-7
I brought one .8 and a seven, get seven from the .8
The white girl love nigga dick, but her rich daddy told her it was rape
Now she in court with the fake, send a nigga upstate
Don't get doped up and get to tweeting, now we speakin'
Calm down, everybody get a round (around) this an NA meeting
I wanna help you out but I don't wanna have to break this clip into pieces
Grandma screamin' ""Aah. Fix it Jesus.""
Salute to the prophet, but we all know that was Mohammad
Don't get ya number called for no reason, I'm pocket dialin'
You throwin' tantrums on stage, that's childish
Everybody can't be like Mike unless you Calvin
Niggas will stab you in the back just to get to the chair
Once they get to your chair they put a dent in ya chair
At the table feastin', that's when those pistols appear
Everybody wanna be Vin Diesel until they wife get killed, now they livin' single, I'm Mark Sinclair
Vin Diesel? Mark Sinclair? Living Single? Sinclair?
Do I gotta make it clear? R.I.P. Craig Mack, pick a Flava I put these bullets In Ya Ear
Say some slick shit out ya mouth and get hit by surprise
With a two piece, now you walkin' with the raccoon eyes
Six shooter, I only gotta let two fly
Or I can let the Remy cry, they thought Papoose died
Gun in ya face pussy, what next?
I might look like a pastor but I got the ladder hangin' from the beak like a duck neck
All these fabricated bars you spittin' got me upset
I run to the scene, you run from the scene, lookin' suspect
If I hit you wit' an uppercut, ya face gon' be upset
I mean literally, he paralyzed, his face got an up set
How dare you try to play me, like I won't give you 80
Bars, crack was poppin' so those jails was crowded in the 80's
This Sugarhill (Sugar Hill) Gang, get Firm with every letter from A-Z
They pronounced him dead and put the tag on the sneaker like Rum Nitty when he battled JC
I'm out in DR grabbin' pussy, fuck the Donald
Then fly to Europe I'm in a hotel near Castellano
With two shotguns in the hand, I'm El Blanco
Sawed off the shotgun look like I cut the nose off Gonzo
OBC, guess what I'ma say next
Mourning; Alonzo
No! Hit him with that shotgun now his body twisted he Alphonso
Stop the stares, Aak, you scared
Two guns, one shootin', the other ad-libbing like Jay-Z in '97 when the Roc was there
It's only 16, shells make ya face burst
Strapped in, the clip hold an angry 13 like a 9th grader that hate church
Either you gon' get this first take or get the take first
The handle wood but the barrel plastic, cool
I learned how to play ball on a crate first
Fucker!
[Round 2: Jimz]
Blac that was doo doo. Raccoon eyes, the fuck outta here

Every battle, in ya intro, you be shoutin' out ""Wayne A.V.E.""
Dunn's funny, my Philly homie said it's been years since you actually touched that curb fam'
You ain't been there since you was Young, Money
The way you turned your back on Wayne, you such a bird, man (Birdman)
It make me wanna call my Richmond homies to come and flame this lame
Cause I got shooters from Jackson Ward to Chamber Lane
And I'm from Queens and I don't bang
But I grew up on a blue block, Hi-C's like a juice box
But growin' up my best friends was Bloods
So I can't really tell you what a Grape will do
But try punkin' Jimz, it's Honey We Shrunk The Kids, I have the big B's (bees) chasin' you
The only time I wear a suit, is we gettin' dressed for court
I been hustlin', got a long connection to the plug like an extension cord
You a family man Hakeem, but keep talkin' out ya neck some more
Y'all gon' have to dial up an ambulance at a high speed to come give Tech support
I was on the computer when I seen ya bitch, that's where I met the whore
We get along cause I like getting head and she likes suckin' large meat
She's a raw freak, her head bangin' 'til the jaw weak
The way the Top left me hangin', had me feelin' like R Streetz
I ain't got shit to say
Except that I battled DNA, Jones, Math and I won the money when I bet Verb
It's been awhile since you battled Miles, since then you puttin' in less work
I been a vets turf, with a silencer on a gun, cause it give me less nerve
It go th-th-th-th it sound like him when he tryin' to say an ""s"" word
You old suckerin' suckatash ass muhfucka
I hate you and ya dirty ass lisp
On Champion with these tight ass suits lookin' like Steven A Spit
You need a fuckin' bib, you be up here droolin' galore
After this, y'all gon' need a couple mops and a few of my cousins to clean up the floor
But you said you wanted to bet on this battle, well I'm willin' to bet, of course
I bet you $1,000 right now, you can't say, ""She sells sea shells by the sea shore
Fuck a joke, cause this could go left soon as it look right
I always been the crook type and we keep Shotguns damn near Suge's height
It got a hit like Harlem White's durin' the Goodz fight
I tell him, ""Stop being dirty"" cause most of y'all dusty
I fill up (Philip) Banks with all street money
Fresh prints (Prince) on the guns for the rappers bein' funny
But the pop will leave you broken in the room like, ""Why he don't want me?""
I walk up like ""Órale papi""
I bet you believe I'm Puerto Rican after ya face get cut
And by the way, bein' a bias analyst makes you lame as fuck
We all know you ain't been shit since back when DNA tamed this pup
But like bein' on the phone in a new relationship, you just don't know when to hang it up
""No you hang up""
""No you hang up""
""No you-""
I heard Qleen Paper's in the buildin'
Well listen Ezel
You only known for the coke and the chokin' like Spreewell
I bet you can get high from just chewin' on ya fingernails
You got that junkie face, crack head strength, but still seem frail
So I ain't gotta lift beams, I'ma just whip Qleen (clean) like I just got it detailed
[Round 2: Tech 9]
You know when I realized you was a fake nigga?
When you did that response blog for Goodz
Got all Hulkamania, turned animal
You remember?
""So what I'm supposed to lay you down?! My kids gotta lose me?!""
Then two seconds later you asked the fans to subscribe to ya channel
Nigga you got punched in the face, cracked ya head on the cement and ya almost died
And the only words you could come up with is...""Subscribe""?

{Tech 9 brings out a drawing of Jimz and Jai Rich Block}

Jai Rich Block told you you can't eat, sleep or SHIT
Well SHIT
You let another man tell you, you can't shit?
Even Daylyt got up on this stage and we all know what he tried to do
SHIT
How fitting, cause when it came to Jai Rich Block/Goodz, you ain't do SHIT

{Tech 9 brings out a drawing of Jimz getting punched}

When Goodz punched you in the face, I felt bad for you
I said, ""I hope Goodz get what he deserves. I hope they start stompin' dude.""
Then you did one of these, ya nose was bloody, you looked mad uncomfortable
I said, ""Snap out of it Jimz! You gonna let these nigga keep punkin' you?""
Then I lost all hope once I seen that punch you threw
My buddy from college is like ""Dude! The fuck is he doin'? He gonna get ruined!""
And I saw Harlem White kick, aah he was doin' the same shit you was doin'
He kickin' beach balls, you throwin' soft balls, y'all all lost
Dumb & Dumber, well I'm here to get rid of these rats, bring in the moth balls
It's only so long fake thugs can pretend
Shout out to my New York niggas with Timbs
Jai Rich Block, Goodz, I pay attention to everything y'all say, 'cause y'all keep droppin' gems (Jimz)
It's a difference between Jim and I, you two-faced like a Gemini
I got two twin arms stuck together, I'm a Gemini!
Let it fly, name the stick with the dot like the letter ""i""
The whistle come and wave in one, now it's the letter ""y""
Hand raised, known for the reach, don't get ya man sprayed
Aim off the charts, I can knock the foot off an ant's leg!
Suge a cop, what's that? I keep a 12 Shotgun in my pants leg
Cardiac arrest, they find Jimz on the ground shakin' his chest like he dance gay
You wanna talk about my speech impediment? Cool
How you a bully but not a fighter?
I don't like bullies, I hit 'em with good nighters
I'm not performin' well at the job, I got the right (write) up
Lispin' Lenny, the silencer sound like me sayin' the word ""spider""
Get popped in the mantle, his brain will bare skin like he rockin' some sandals
Now he got to fair (affair) with the nurse and the doc like a hospital scandal
If he make it out alive, another plot to get handled
Geechi Gotti, I need a favor
I call Crip and have him put the flag on Jimz like they don't rock wit' his channel
These fuckers is breakin' the code, who the fuck is coachin' these hoes?
You only speak when you spoken to, well these bitches is breakin' the code
Well I guess I gotta choke a nigga, twist his arms, break up his nose
Stomp his ass with dress shoes: Kenneth da Cole!
Oh, well, we in good luck 'cause tonight I got on my Kenneth da Coles
Gun named ""Kenneth"" he cold, I got a code for Kenneth
The shot perfect, and the kickback is oh, terrific
You gonna catch this drill sergeant, that means ya soldiers missin'
Come through with one bald head like Twork with the hoodie down
Jimz, you pussy and you know who did it!
Round 2
2-0, bitch!

[Round 3: Jimz]
This battle wasn't set up for me to win
If you don't believe that then you know less facts
'Cause how the fuck is the theme for this event called Survivor Series and they already got Tech booked for his next match?
And by the way, it's dead trash
Tech 9 versus Geechi Gotti...pee pee potty
They only fuck witchu cause you're JayBlac's Uber driver
If you think any different than you a liar
Y'all give him Jimz then Geechi? You must want dude to retire
'Cause (Cuz) we all know you below sea (C) level like a scuba diver
But shout out Loso, A. Ward and Th3 Saga
Those are my guys and I don't want no prob'
But right now, on this stage, in front of this fraud, oh we gotta play a game we like to call 'Swear To God'
Swear to God, the night that you battled Head I.C.E, the homie popped shit
Then they had you and your man lookin' like some bitches
Smack, this is something even you witnessed
Swear to God after the event the homies didn't run y'all up the block with the quickness
Everyone seen it, Tech
But you wanna talk about my business?
But when it comes to beef, you don't want it
Only time I ran the block is when I had work on it
I'll take you outta ya space if you don't calm it (comet)
Beam on the machine, I used the laser so much I had to change the bulb on it
Those is bars, raccoon motherfucka
Swear to God you haven't been shot before, back in the day clown
I know this is true, cause I heard the Philly interview and it was said right out this lame's mouth
But did you get the strap, load up and let it bang out?
Nah, nah, all you did was nothin' and feel the pain from the bullet every time it rain out
So go ahead and talk about the suckers that set me up is probably still out there grinnin'
But does it compare to how the motherfucka who put a bullet in him is still out there livin'?
See y'all like to talk about circumstances, but never been in it
I could've took that Goodz situation and make it hideous
But when he called and said, ""I'm sorry. I don't wanna fight. Let's not continue this.""
Sometimes as a man, you realize it's better to end the war instead of finish it
See I ain't a Blood or a Crip, I never had to bang wit' a set
And I never left my homies behind, I was the one who got left
I've shot, been shot at, but I don't want no respect cause I've aired mine Tech
I've more proud to say I've been jumped, sucker punched, but pussy I ain't lose a fair one yet
You can't win talkin' 'bout sucker punches and make up ethnicities
You have to let your pen speak
And by the way, you owe everything Jay pussy, you Memph' Bleek
I'll rock a fella (Rocafella), 'til his head begin to leak
I'm still hustlin' that white boy, I get it in the streets
Did he (Diddy) know if you want all this snow (Aldous Snow) you gotta Get Him To The Greek?
Yeah, that's somethin' that I laugh at
Cause I ain't even half that
Just cause you got white skin, it doesn't make you white
That thought process is sickening
I got friends that are black as shit, but them motherfuckers is Dominican
But fuck all that, y'all remember when he said ""I'm old school. I'll put peanut butter on a mouse trap""?
(That's fire!)
It was, but not in my house scrap
Cause growin' up wastin' food in my crib will get ya mouth slapped
See I grew up on food stamps and welfare, the type of shit that made me feel less cool
Whatchu know about watchin' ya mother cry over the things she couldn't get you
But those hard times in life is what give ya chest fuel
I never had PayPerView, my mother was against Cable like Deadpool
I only took this battle, cause we tired of seein' this bum frontin'
Y'all only like him now-a-days cause he follow JayBlac around; cum guzzlin'
But it's been almost 10 years in battle rap since you done somethin'
Champion? You the only champion I know

{Scuffle breaks out}

Champion? He the only champion I know that never won nothin'
You wouldn't face these kind of bars with 10 years in prison
And battle rap is not a friends, this a competition
And I don't care what y'all rep, you just another victim
And Technisha's dirty so that's how I did him

[Round 3: Tech 9]
It was all love, peace and soul
Til this piece took love soul
Soul train...love, aah peace and soul
Don't try to stop me, I ain't the trained dog you wanna stick ya hand in
Don't lose ya hand friend
Go from lendin' a hand 'til ya hand losin' a limb
That's usually what happens when you go out on a limb
Did y'all comprehend? I cut his hand off he bled to death, he went out on a limb
Don't turn this Family Feud into a Dark night (Knight) and get Harvey Dent
Cause don't nobody win when the family feud, well...try explainin' that to a Jew
Cause money's the only thing that makes the family move
At 18 I gave my mother a hug and before I could let go she told me the rent was due
You 29 livin' rent free, all ya mother is doin' is cripplin' you
Look at you, with ya high price clothes and ya Gucci sneaks up on ya mom's couch in her living room
Ya girlfriend come over for movie night, well, y'all can't laugh too loud cause mama told you about those giggle moves
Ya step pop walk past you angry lookin' at you
""Despicable""
Ya big sis' moved out five years ago and you still inquiring about the bigger room

[Jimz]
I live alone!

[Tech 9]
Pitiful, only time Jimz got his own spot, when these leagues book a room
Then he turn on the camera like, ""Yanamsayin', that's how we livin' dude.""
You a fraud, a con artist, and you be tellin'
I set the trap, I knew you was a convict once you fell in (felon)
Pick a ring card, Smack got these white bitches on stage dancin' like they Ellen
Two .8's come from the corner pocket, wave it at ya melon
Don't get Lost In New York, I'm Home Alone dancin' wit' the arms like I'm Kevin
Cougar!
Nah fuck that, I can have his mom cryin' at his funeral beatin' on his box, I Doug E. Fresh him
Dude you stupid, I'm Champion, plus the recap is ruthless
Tell ya ex girlfriend I kill her ex-men (X-Men) in front of Storm, Professor, choose a mutant
I brought a .45, an AR with somethin' packed in the nose it's mucus
I'm the wrong profile you wanna pick, that'll make me circle with the mask like Kenny Lewis
While I, troll my account, and it's Ah Di eyes, that mean it's too Boom for ya pupils that's how you traumatize (trauma eyes)
You scream drama until a nigga bring drama, now he don't want no drama ties (dramatize)
Walkin' down ya strip, Fedora on, they can' t tell if it's The Undertaker or Vada Fly
Y'all think Kenny is Vada? Not today
Cause when I said I circle with the mask I meant Jagged J
Pull a rusty blade out, put a jag in J
Then I'll put the cats on his Jag', do him the jaguar way
What is you? What is you? Mexican? Puerto Rican? You Tekashi with this rhyme shit?
Well I turn that 69 backwards and do you like 2Pac in '9-6
Jimz ready for the URL, that's nonsense
Slow it down, ya whole battle career is a meme, give him the Con' pick
Catch a mug shot for real, give him a con' pick
Wild out and get a slice from the Cannon, that's a Con' trip
What happened Captain, you in America, catch a Red Skull
Iron man (Ironman), I'm low key (Loki), I get you picked off
You in my Vision, I got the Hulk, then you Doom'ed Doc
Tell ya uncle ""kill all that ruckus"" before I turn The Avengers into The Boondocks
I'm a Star Lord, Doctor gonna be lookin' at this Uno Strange when I draw four
War with the Machine, hammer in hand like the boy Thor
I could do this for Infinity Jimz (gems), what's on ya mind Jim?
The reality is, you runnin' outta time Jim (gem)
You gonna catch all this power, you don't give me space Jim (gem)
Lift his soul, Thanos, you catchin' six Jim (gem)
I'm a Champion, he's not a contender

There I was just mindin' my own business

I'd seen that shadow once before, in my life
Well, it was the day my father died
So, I turned and I fled, but that shadow gave chase
Caught me down a dead end way
To my surprise when he opened his mouth
Well, I could hear my father say
He said, ""Son, I know just where you've been, yeah
And I know just how you'll meet your end
You better turn from the path that you're on
Lest you end up just like your old man""
Hold up, wait a minute there man, like
Did you forget who you were? You used to beat my mother down
Well, she left your sorry ass, because you wouldn't choose

I've been the cause and the cure to your misery
And since I ain't in love with you its a mystery
Why I never call and you missing me

Guess its just the pimp in me or is she pimping me

A Alma e o Pecado,rap,Fuse,127.0,"[Intro]

[Verso 1]
Quanto custa a fé de um devoto a Cristo?
Até que ponto sacrificas o espírito?
Descobre o diabo que há em ti e convida-o
A um exorcismo coletivo auto-destrutivo
Feitiçaria? O mal não vem por magia…
É parido na perversão do dia-a-dia
O nosso inferno interior é um estado nato
Purgatório que oscila entre a alma e o pecado
Crescemos com o sentido da moralidade
Mas desenvolvemos uma raiz de brutalidade
É a lei da sobrevivência…
O desafio à inteligência, o consciente é violado pela demência
A inveja… a coima paga pela alma é o sacrifício na crença
Será que a morte de Jesus valeu a pena?
O meu papel é o de acusador ao culto
Do fanatismo que reencarna a cada segundo

[Refrão]
A chama que queima a alma é o pecado
Carência, malícia, a ruína, ser humano
É o diabo, que reina no profeta ou no fraco
O tempo vem de luto, o juiz é preparado
A chama que queima a alma é o pecado
Carência, malícia, a ruína, ser humano
É o diabo, que reina no profeta ou no fraco
O tempo vem de luto, o juiz é preparado

[Verso 2]
Ateus, agnósticos, fracos ou religiosos fanáticos
Na futilidade são como cegos
Contradição numa moral de podridão
Vejo ao longe os estragos da imputação
A encarnação do Messias é alegórica…
Mas a corrosão do ser humano já é histórica
Voam como anjos delegados do Espírito Santo
Mas o que escondem com as asas é macabro
Uma vez por ano ajoelham-se até Fátima…
Mas no resto do tempo põem a malícia em prática
Mentem, roubam, invejam, competem, agridem…
Não dão importância aos atos que cometem
Não descansam enquanto não têm o que querem…
Estremecem quando se tornam no que temem
Até o diabo tem um gesto puritano…
São falsos como cópias do livro de São Cipriano

[Refrão]
A chama que queima a alma é o pecado
Carência, malícia, a ruína, ser humano
É o diabo, que reina no profeta ou no fraco
O tempo vem de luto, o juiz é preparado
A chama que queima a alma é o pecado
Carência, malícia, a ruína, ser humano
É o diabo, que reina no profeta ou no fraco
O tempo vem de luto, o juiz é preparado

[Verso 2]
Venho do escuro, com pensamentos puros
Sem escudo ou lágrimas venho lançar o esconjuro
Corpo, sangue e alma, Eucaristia…
Este canto que vos trago é a vossa hóstia
Locais de culto para obterem a graça
Ou a bênção da desgraça…a IURD é uma farsa!
A fundação da religião não era o objectivo
Mas sim guiar o ser humano ao livre arbítrio
Instituições da salvação, oradores da imposição
Desafiam as leis da Criação
O desequilíbrio entre o positivo e o negativo
Empalações ao vivo em figuras de misticismo
O dinheiro vem servido num cálice de sangue
O mal é residente no cicloscópio da mente
É o epílogo que entrego de um mundo que renego
Mentes fracas são talhadas a cutelo

A chama que queima a alma é o pecado
Carência, malícia, a ruína, ser humano

Lado Sujo do Mapa,rap,Gigante No Mic,106.0,"[Gigante no Mic]
Eu sou da gangue da Askov mas não nego um Duelo
Ficando alto igual Mario depois de um cogumelo
Eu quero prata, eu quero ouro, mas o que eu zelo
Mas importante que as corrente é manter o elo
Me passa o Kombuya misturo com Kaya
Não tem fomo faiar. É clic bum! Faya!
Converso com Gaya dialeto de um maia
Até sol raiar laia laia

Life style de um vagabundo
Que vive no mundo jogado igual ludo
Se vida é um baile eu danço com tudo
E sigo às cegas no modo noturno

Enxergo a frente
Memo no escuro não temo o futuro
Vivendo o presente, rasgando o embrulho
Foda-se a embalagem, tenho conteúdo

No mundo da lua
Vivendo a rua que é o meu habitat
Seu filho me imita e você que é coxinha
Sabe que perdeu e não pode evitar
Eu pago minhas contas
Fumando maconha e fazendo meus RAP
Desde moleque eu sabia que ia dar nisso
Mudando de vida mais do que de CEP

[REFRÃO]
É o lado sujo do mapa
Existe vida no bueiro meu chapa
A onda bate nuns tapa
Renascendo do cinzeiro noiz chapa

To fechadão com meus parça
To removendo as farpas
Quem for vagabundo faz sinal de fumaça

[Moita Treta ]
Fumo a ponta dentro do punto
Três beck em cinco minutos
Não alivia um terço do luto
Mercado, maloca metendo furto
Polícia na porta caralho que  susto
Me aborda do nada  quase eu discuto
Minha veia bolada voltando do culto
Fazendo dinheiro é hoje que eu surto
Enchi o bloco de notas
Agora é o bolso de notas
Escrevia ''cês'' nem via
Hoje não sai da minha bota
Desculpa moça meu estilo é vira-lata
A culpa não é minha se seu filho me idolatra
To chapado que to dando dica pro psiquiatra
Bebo sempre manobrando o copo igual acrobata
O que não mata engorda, mas o que engorda te mata
Transformando home de ferro, muito ego em sucata

No solo da guita, no boteco eu chap
Chapa que a vida tá curta
Não curto dar teco mas já fui no taco
A rapa da linha que insulta
Insulto o solto leve
Comigo o choro é livre
Viu vulto, os chará deve
Sem cheira coca tive

Only walls I see are the ones up inside you
How am I supposed to know the things you need

When i should have been getting through
You're gonna have to start living without it

Jetzt komm'n sie angekrochen, plötzlich woll'n sie Freunde sein
Suchen Rücken, wollen Schutz, doch allen den Erfolg nicht teil'n

Denn Taten sprechen irgendwann und dann ist Schluss mit Reden
Jetzt brauchst du Schutz, du Esel, du scheiß Pinocchio
Wo sind deine Waffen aus dein'n Clips? Ein Schmock bist du
Wo sind die harten Jungs, die immer böse gucken?
Die hinter Kameras bei meinen Brüdern Schwänze lutschen
Zu gefährlich für umsonst, denn es wird ernst
Wer macht sich grade für ein'n Schmock? Doch du wirst lern'n
Denn hier bei mir fallen Kugeln auch am Tag

Doch Gosse seid ihr alle nicht, ihr Opfer zahlt für Schutz
Jeder will mit Rocker häng'n oder mit 'ner Großfamilie
Realness hier ist tot, denn nur noch Image wird hier großgeschrieben

Ich will zerfetzen und morden, am besten jetzt und nicht morgen

And wherever you end up all the men get drunk
And pull all your strings
And charm you away

If you think you’ll get back to this town
I promise I’ll clean up if you think you might take me along

But you wouldn’t share the thoughts you had
And when you tried to phone your friends
You never shared the word with them
Now you’re too proud to let them know it ain’t safe
And their fashion and friends won’t give you romance
But you still check the lines on their hands

Set the alarm for the crack of noon
And you doused that thing with your flat champagne
I felt a little love in my jugular vein

And the air was sticky-sweet,
You was too

Si disculpame ,pero esperame que ya voy , si!

Si si no tardo

Que paso , como fue , que tu amor se seco
Si los dos eramos lluvia y cielo
De tu ser , de tu mar , ni una gota quedo
Y al vacio cae sin alas ni viento

Sola en el silencio , solamente yo
Estoy tan sola
Sola con tu sombra y todo mi dolor
Que voy hacer sin tu amor
Sin ti no hay noches ni dias, yo
Soy una lagrima cuando no estas
Cuando no estas, cuando no estas

Para que , para quien , di mi alma y mi piel
Si te vas sin piedad , sin palabras
No va mas , se acabo , y ahora que termino
De que vale vivir atado en recuerdos
Sola en el silencio , solamente yo
Estoy tan sola
Sola con tu sombra y todo mi dolor
Que voy hacer sin tu amor
Sin ti no hay noches ni dias
Yo soy una lagrima cuando , cuando no estas

No no noo noo , por un milagro de tu amor me olvidare
Yo me quedare aferrada a ti , esperandotee

Sola en el silencio , solamente yo

Viven en la oscuridad

Gritos que no cesarán
Siente su piel

Hay que subsistir

De ese cuerpo

Killin' a lie by tellin' the truth

Forget everything and leave it in the past
I swear I did everything, I tried to make to make it last (Yeah)

Frozen up, so in love, with you

Frozen up, so in love, with you

Did everything you asked for
Blaming me is so unfair
Don't be a bitch, don't call me ""asshole""

Когда палец прошел
И все раны затянулись
Мне так хорошо
Собираю рифмы с улиц
Мне так нужен порошок
Белый цвет ему так кстати
Слышу песни за окном
Дед мороз в моей кровати

Ты прислушайся, не задавай лишних вопросов
Хорошо себя вести будешь, верну домой и с носом
Я хочу лишь разобраться, что тут случилось
Куда дел любимый снег, и куда вера испарилась

Пойми, люди нынешние в тебя не верят
Они любят власть и больше денег на счету
Парик, надевают тебя косплеют за кэш
Горит, вера в тебя, когда ты нужен им всем
Пойми
Даже дети в тебя перестали верить
Новый год уже вот вот на той неделе
Ничего в этом году потерпит челядь
Я не согласен, все тут уже устали верить

Никто уже тебе не поклоняется
Никто тебя не ждет на коврике крыльца
У елки все лишь ждут свои подарки
Новый год стал очередным поводом напиться в парке

Ты Питер Паркер, запертый в комиксах
Ты лишь идея сделать бизнес ходить в ролексах
На утро тебя никто не вспомнит когда опомнится
И всё вернется в прежнее русло работа с утреца

И я не вижу своего лица
Нет
И снега нет одни тела на улицах
Бред
Я вижу то что я больше не умница
Нет
Всё что ты оставил лишь мокрый след подлеца
Бред

Итак
Я здесь тебя не держу, но мне нужен твой посох
Когда-нибудь тебе верну
Когда налажу, проблемы и в космос
Я улечу, вернусь с надеждой без спроса
Подарю людям мечту
Заберу их отсюда нарочно
Я здесь тебя не держу, но мне нужен твой посох
Когда-нибудь тебе верну
Когда налажу, проблемы и в космос
Я улечу, вернусь с надеждой без спроса
Подарю людям веру в мечту
Заберу их отсюда нарочно",0.2409856840968132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An outcast astray from their path

Days are like the wind and my exile within reach

Under the moon I am still
To witness such decay god must be dead
Whispers in my ear, the wind brings a creed
I am a forest and a night of dark trees

Armonia  Caos,rap,MezzoSangue,143213.0,"[Testo di ""Armonia & Caos""]

[Intro]
“C'è qualcosa nell'arte, come nella natura del resto
Che ci rassicura, e qualcosa che invece, ci tormenta, ci turba
Due sentimenti eterni in perenne lotta
La ricerca dell'ordine e il fascino del caos:
Dentro questa lotta abita l'uomo, e ci siamo noi, tutti
Ordine e disordine
Cerchiamo regole, forme, canoni, ma non cogliamo mai il reale funzionamento del mondo
È per gli uomini un eterno mistero
L'incapacità di risolvere questo mistero ci terrorizza, ci costringe a oscillare tra la ricerca di un'armonia impossibile
E l'abbandono dal caos”

[Strofa 1]
Curami coi sogni che hai saputo darmi, toglimi dai drammi
Dammi solo quanto basta
E su ogni cassa squarterò gli affanni
Passa gli anni accanto a me che invecchieremo insieme
Come pelle sul mio corpo o sangue nelle vene
Crepe sopra il foglio ma so reinventarmi
Spogliarmi dei miei panni per mostrarti i tagli
Nudo senza vergognarmi
Giuro non so fra chi collocarti:
Non so se stai fra le armature oppure fra le armi
Fra le cure o i tagli
Scure notti proverò a sdraiarmi, tu ad accarezzarmi
Con le rughe e i calli di chi ha in mano gli anni
Noi due stanchi dentro un mondo di ologrammi
Avremo ancora i sogni
Coi miei figli a sbeffeggiarmi che starò sui fogli
Forse non sapranno quanto hai fatto per me
Forse non c'avranno l'arte, avranno i numeri e se
Così sarà io avrò fallito e sarò morto per te
Come un soldato in una guerra di parole e di idee
[Strofa 2]
Vieni e aiutami, baby, non ci sto più con la testa
Ho scritto versi su versi, c'ho messo l'anima a bestia
La notte più arida è questa: abbandònati al caos
Nello scorrere lento Dio guarda triste e fa ""ciao""
Il tempo batte e fa ""Blawn"", sapessi scrivere merda
Tu avresti in alto le mani quanto più in basso la testa
Io avrei il mio salto domani e la morte delle mie gesta
Cuore ogni notte mi chiami per fare a gara a chi resta?
Sogno un testa a testa con Dio, piani che non svelo
Faccio un testa coda con l'io, mami non cedo
Lo tsunami che aspetto, e il cambiamento del gioco
Non parte certo dalle onde, parte da un terremoto
Io ho fatto a botte col vuoto il più delle volte (volte)
M'ha dato botte su botte il più delle volte
E ho visto gli occhi all'hip hop in giornate storte
M'ha detto che ringraziarla è imparare ad essere forte

Sleep Awake,rap,Gracy Hopkins,69.0,"[Verse 1]
I just follow my dreams, so sleep is the lead
No physical wounds everytime that I bleed
If life's Twitter, only got Win in my feed
Man, I'm smokin' all these rappers, MCs is my weed
All your niggas know it's bedtime
Know you thought I was the funny guy
If you wanna get a shakin' booty, get a pony ride
I got pain and got gain on the other side
I'm bout to kill all these fake friends, call it homiecide
They say I think better when I sleep awake
Road is wet, while I'm runnin', niggas slip away
Honestly, can U find somebody hard as me?
If somebody got it, I just got a different policy
And my haters crying for me like they name was Jodeci
I'm so far, dont complain' if it's hard to see me
Music more than a hobby, more than a passion
Trendsetter so they call me Grandmaster Fashion
What about Run DMC?
Golden age gone, now it's weed and sip
I'm tryna get me a new mindset
Like a fool, mind slept, all I do is blind tests, nigga
Even love is alcohol and if you don't believe me, the proof is in roses
My mind is a guy that the process, they don't need no highlighters to stab him low
My only drug is the truth, maybe this is why I'm always faded
Keep my mind high, and my pain in a booth, short smiles is that shit I always hated
Time goes, people changes
Now it snows, then it rains
Broken bond, I skipped a day
Guess a little nigga just sleep awake
[Chorus 1]
Stop talkin' to me when I sleep awake...
Stop talkin' to me when I sleep awake...

[Bridge]
Let the keys talk, and please don't make no sound...
Just feel the vibe of the music take your whole body...
I guess you have goosebumps right now...
Yeah..

[Verse 2]
What about that pain I live? I want my mind to beat my flesh
I already told it was time to leave, I want the world to feel my passion
Want that girl to see I'm fresh, whoever she is, I need her
I propose to fly to the free world, I heard they was lookin' for a leader
Feel like she wanna leave a word to someone, she was lookin' for a reader
Feel like she was starving of answers, so sorry that I can't feed her
Feel like she already know who I am, tryna guess where I seen her
But I know that face and I ain't a dont-believe-in-ghosts type of sinner
And I close my eyes now, than I wake up in a ghost town
Than I get closer to that pretty girl, my eyes so heavy, body goes down
Still dont remember how I landed there
Went to Molière's town to Lady D's country
In a sec, she controllin' the dream
That girl is so sexy but trolling the prince
Tell me who you are please answer
If you want the key of the mind, please enter
I know that you know how I feel, let's be serious, it's not a game girl
Next line is a quote, I fall, I'm nervous
Hear ""the best is not perfect and the rest is not worth it"" wake up!
[Chorus]
You live for bitches and blunts, we live for freedom only
You live for bitches and blunts, we live for freedom only
(She stopped talkin' to me, but I'm still awake)
You live for bitches and blunts, we live for freedom only
You live for bitches and blunts, we live for freedom only
(She stopped talkin' to me, now I'm still awake)

For a moment, I thought I was crazy...
And for an other moment, I thought I found why I was agressive...
Knew it was something missing in me... Is she that missing part?
Yeah... yeah... Now please let the keys play",0.29745654098223895,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors

Que diable Satan,pop,Guy Bart,13.0,"Satan ne croyait plus en Dieu
Ne croyait plus au merveilleux
Il ne croyait en somme
Qu'à c' qu'il voyait : les hommes
Satan ne voyait plus les Cieux
Chemin faisant il rencontra
Courant une bande de rats
Qui chantaient à tue-tête
Des refrains malhonnêtes
Satan, bien sûr, les ignora

Que diable, Satan
Depuis des siècles qu'on t'attend
Si tu n' crois plus, c'est inquiétant
Que diable, Satan
Que diable fais-tu à présent
Qu' n'importe qui est malfaisant ?

Il s'en alla dans la cité
Croisant des foules excitées
Oh, pas vraiment méchantes
Pour quatre francs cinquante
Des âmes à vendre au rabais
Oui, mais à quatre pas de là
Il tomba sur un drôle de gars
Adolescent cynique
Qui lui dit sans panique
""Non, voyons, tu n'existes pas""
Que diable, Satan
Puisque tu ne crois plus en Dieu
Pauv' diable, tu n' fais plus sérieux
Que diable, Satan
Tu veux trop vivre avec ton temps
Tu n'es même plus excitant

Ô chimère, ôte-toi de là
Tu ne crois plus en l'au-delà
Et c'est irrémédiable
Tu n'es qu'un effroyable
Guignol en costume de gala
Personne ne croit plus ici
Et partout ça sent le roussi
La vertu, c'était triste
Mais soyons réalistes
Le mal est devenu triste aussi

Que diable, Satan
Depuis que tu n'es plus croyant
On n' te croit plus, c'est effrayant
Que diable, Satan
Puisque te voici mécréant
Tu n'es plus que fumée, néant

Poussa des sanglots de douleur
""Que Léviathan m'assiste
Si de ce temps j'existe
Dieu existe aussi, j'en ai peur""

Ahí te va

[Verso 1: Víctor Rutty]
Pa muchos una causa es una pausa en su trayecto
Para mí, no, no hay nada como sentirlo aquí dentro
100% activo en este juego, ¿quién me pisa el freno?
Después de los años que llevo tachando modelos
Veo como pasa el tiempo y tú
Fuiste mi deseo como el de toda la juventud
Peligros hay golosa, pero yo sigo en mi propia luz
(?) Como dice mi hermano el Yousuff
Crecí en el barrio y eso no me hizo ser malo
Dejé todos los estudios por estar siempre a tu lado
Contigo he reído, llorado, dejé a un lado los eslalos
Hoy cargo con errores que no borro del pasado
Todo lo que sé, es por ella
Ella me enseñó lo que no aprendí en la escuela
Son cosas malas, buenas, algo tienes que envenena
Yo era un puto mierda cuando andaba por ella
Cada camino es un recuerdo, el tiempo mata y es verdad
Sé que te echaré de menos
Hechan mierda en sus cuadernos, no lo entiendo
Porque a mí me sobra calle que le falta a esos raperos
Desde pequeño con ella codo a codo
Quise esquivarla en momentos malos que pasamos todos
Ella fue la brota de mis poros
Sin ella en esta vida yo me sentiría solo
[Coro: Rober del Pyro]
Sabe todas las preguntas y a quien se junta
Parece buena ten cuidado no te confundas
Anda todo el día con droga, con cabrones, con ladronas
Con siete miles de millones de personas
Sabe todas las preguntas y a quien se junta
Parece buena ten cuidado no te confundas
Anda todo el día por ahí mirando al sin nada que perder
Esperando un nuevo amanecer

[Verso 2: Shotta}
Cuando tengo ganas de llorar ella me desahoga
Ella me llama pa que salga, da igual la hora
Ella entiende de lágrimas y disgustos
Ella es un niño disponible siempre con un balón de fútbol
Ella no entiende de canis ni de pijitos
Ella no entiende de North Face ni chalecos de pico
Ella es la justicia por encima de la ley
Me sacó un sexto sentido, me hizo pasar mucho frío
La quiero y necesito, la odio y la desprecio
Si tú también la has conocido estás pagando el precio
¿Has sentido el dolor del pobre, el dolor del perdedor?
Si te críaste en un palacio, necio, agradécelo
Miseria vive en ella, también la alegría y el sol
Ella es bella y fea al mismo tiempo, el odio y el amor
En ella es donde he rapeado desde siempre
Que escuches el tema en ella y con toda tu gente
Ella para mi era como un cuento, un desfase
Mentía si le decía ""Ahora vuelvo"", a mi madre

And in the trap scales, zips and baggies
And in the can is where my niggas are sittin’

Cade Dragă Cerul,rap,Samurai,186.0,"[Vers 1: Lian]
Călător pe diguri, întotdeauna răsăritul și apusul
Poate cel mai frumos lucru posibil
Dar știi ce mă intrigă însă că acuma pot citi printre riduri
E ca o taină nepătrunsă amprenta timpului pe trupuri
Tu ești suflet pur, eu doar un joker tăcut
Sătul de trucuri. Îmi spuneai că asta-i doar o joacă de copii
Acum te cred pe cuvânt și te rog nu mai vorbi prin absurd
Că starea asta îmi provoacă aritmii și m-am trezit în trecut
Cu același gust acru; e frica din adâncul inimii
Și chipul tău e sacru. Păstrează-mi spiritul în cadru
Și cade dragă cerul, suntem singuri într-un câmp gen indigo
Deci care este sensul? Mă vezi cum mă împiedic în atâtea tempo-uri
Serios, caut limpezimi și cuvintele sunt de prisos

[Vers 2: Samurai]
M-am întrebat de-atâtea ori oare observă dacă plec?
Atâtea suflete sub cer, de ce le-ar trebui unul defect?
Nu înțeleg de ce se prefac că totu-i perfect
Și marea se supără iarna când oamenii nu mai trec
S-o vadă și durerea ei se simte
Dacă întrebi ce s-a-ntâmplat imi zice ""nimic"" și se-nchide
Îmi trimite un val, mă-nghite
Îmi ia nisipul din clepsidră, îmi ia prea mult să mă vindec
Când te văd că te pierzi în adânc
În suflet strâng, suntem la fel, nici eu nu vorbesc
Rămân tăcut c-am folosit cuvinte ce rănesc
Atât de mult m-am antrenat să zic tot ce gândesc
Ce simt, pierdut în infinit, în timp totul pare nimic
[Vers 3: Samurai]
Cică poeții mor de foame, tu să nu-i crezi
Doar că poeții trăiesc drame și-au nevoie de-un medicament
Și după de un stimulent ca să se simtă vii
N-au timp de oameni, panarame, de atâția copii
Ah, unii trăiesc viața pe fugă
Alții se închid în temple și timpul trecut îl uită
Lasă mintea să creeze, nu contează pe-unde umblă
Inima o să trieze dacă nu e amorțită încă
Am chef de ducă, mă urc în mașină, plec
Soarele-n spate, inima rece din piept
Nici măcar nu mai bate, e inutil să o resuscitez
Că are o perspectivă aparte, totul e intens
Ah, și eu credeam că e exact invers
Și eu credeam că e exact invers
Și eu credeam că e exact invers",0.3621400324627757,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mais je te dois si peu et j´aurai?

[refrain] :
De la peine pas de chagrin
Un peu de regret mais pas de pleurs
De la peine pas de chagrin
Tu es le passé pas le bonheur

Notre éternité dura si peu
Tu sais le temps n´y est pour rien
Souvent tes mensonges crevaient les yeux
Mais ta vérité mentait si bien

[refrain]

Comme un nuage chassé par le vent
Comme une image fanée par le temps
Tu ne seras plus qu´un souvenir lointain
Qu´un nom parmi d´autres noms et plus rien
Et un jour, passant devant chez toi
Je me dirai qui habitait là
Je le sais d´avance, je t´oublierai
Et j´oublierai même que j´avais?

[refrain]

Et notre histoire ne mérite pas
Des cris, des larmes mais j´aurais parfois

Indefinite Archetype,pop,Hexen,73.0,"Blind and indignant, you won’t see that your own statements are contradicting
Your very existence, take a hint, what is perceived is subjective reality
The path that is chose, be it yours, lay wasted away by denials and chores
Determined to prove that confusion is vice, in an endless abyss of limitless sacrifice
Numbers don’t lie and neither do I, thus spoke the ancients in patterns and dye
Collective unconscious much less a dream, to understand life is to attain ability
What once was certain now is lost to the hands of the victims of the albatross
Insight and knowledge easily skewed became the misconception that guides your view towards…
Life
Indefinite archetype!
Intricate balance, many ways in which light shall pierce the ubiquitous haze
Cause and effect, a mere paradigm, transcends beyond chance yet distorters deny
Manifestation for humanity is more than attesting half-truths with daunting beliefs
When immediate action proves sane men naïve, an existential source is vastly decreed
Falsified heroes paving lines by which lives are altered and chosen ones thrive
If as above so below, now we must conquer our-selves to forgo
The pendulum prophecies lay beneath the tides falling to rise, observe and be seen
Among twilight’s idols, indivisibly, wisdom and instinct entwine and is born unto thee
Indefinite archetype!
Cast into a darkened plane by which shadows may escape the past
Consolation for dire souls flung towards the unnerving black
If the ego is the ghost that has arisen from the grave of the self
Then expect it to act in ghoulish ways!
Principle knowledge, once possessed, likened to comfort, lays one to rest
Indiscrete memory, condemned to forget, that which preceded our lives to beget
Ages of solace, no one sees, the opportune sequences made to appease
Correspondence, calculative success, the incontestable machinations of progress

My haters say rap is bad, but that attitude is gonna fade away just like YOLO bullshit fad

Screaming Live In Wapping London UK,rock,Newtown Neurotics,13.0,"Somewhere out in that godforsaken night
Time was running out for you
And as I dropped exhausted into bed
The global atmospherics carried news
I'd been out too long
Too tired to turn the radio on
All I wanted was sleep......
Now listen, I’m not one for worshipping the past
It's deceitful and plays tricks upon the mind
But to ignore it would be just as bad
As pretending you've no nose between your eyes:
I awoke to the phone
""Good start to the day"" I moaned as I got out of bed
I stood in the freezing cold
Listening to your solemn tone
As you told me he was dead

Chorus:
I felt like screaming, I felt like losing control
A tingling sensation crept over my soul
I had a feeling as the tears poured out
A tingling sensation crept over my scalp
I read the newspapers, those bastions of lies
And wondered how much of it was true
’cos in the past they seemed to take delight
In writing loads of rubbish about you
Soon they'll advertise shoddy products and merchandise
The final fortunes of fame

IMAGINE you've no privacy throughout your waking life
Every careless word and rash remark held up towards the light
Every movement, every posture, every smile and every turn
Is documented carefully for the world
Whilst in the FBI a dossier has come to light
Its existence is finally proved
Watch the ones who spat in his face
Bend over backwards to say he was great
They've turned the final screw.....

Chorus:
I felt like screaming, I felt like losing control
A tingling sensation crept over my soul
I had a feeling as the tears poured out
A tingling sensation crept over my scalp

How can you morn for a single man
When thousands die every day
Well.. a powerful voice for human rights
Has been stopped from having its say

J’me voyais déjà bronzé eux m’voyaient comme un matelot
Ils m’ont dit viens avec nous mais c’tait rien qu’pour torcher l’paquebot

On vit sous l’inquisition d’leur musique de grand-père
Dès qu’j’prends l’volant j’blast le son, ma musique les enterre
Dieu merci j’attends pu l’bus, j’me lève moins en maudit
Pis tant pis si l’public a downloadé ma Audi

La foule veut qu’l’artiste se sacrifie comme Jésus
Mais chus pas l’fils de Dieu chus rien qu’le fils d’un pendu
J’protège mes acquis, chérie va m’chercher l’morceau
Ya un mc s’ul perron en train d’buster mon flow

Crisse ton cd dans’vidanges le gros pis on est quitte

On compte le cash, on parle ensuite
On laisse les rats au fond d’la cage mentalité d’esclaves en fuite

J’aime mieux forcer les verrous d’la morale bien pensante
Si jamais j’échoue chu prêt à porter l’blâme
Ils vont m’censurer mais ils vont jamais s’approcher d’l’âme

J’ai vieilli, ramenez vote public de matante
J’leur vendrai d’la patente, j’les ferai danser en chantant l’attente

J’écrirai comme TVA j’en aurai fait mon maître

Francophone que’ l’cris, vrai de vrai, autrement dit
Si mon disque débarque en France c’est par la Normandie
Mon honnêteté c’est toute c’que j’ai face à la grosse machine

J’roule à 240 chevaux sur l’sentier d’la guerre
J’trouverai l’repos quand j’trouverai ma piaule au pied d’la mer
Qu’est-ce que j’pourrais faire pour les autres à part prôner la paix
J’aurai jamais ni l’pouvoir ni les milliards à Desmarais

On est les esclaves du système, c’pas la peine qu’on s’en parle
Faut travailler sur soi-même vu qu’les chaînes sont mentales
Ya rien d’gratuit gros la vie fait pas d’cadeau
Pour toucher ses rêves on s’bat, on crève à la Falardeau
On veut s’faire dire oui mais faut être patient quand c’est non
On peut d’mander à Mandela si vingt-sept ans c’est long
J’parle à ceux d’en bas ceux d’en haut comprennent jamais rien
Chus pro-humain comment tu veux qu’chois anti-Canadien

Comment juger une personne que par ses origines
Ils vont nous r’faire une troisieme guerre l’homme est incorrigible

Been quiet, too quiet now
Rappers got their bars on a diet now
Gotta tell my backpack to keep it down
Trolls wanna riot now, control em like a choir now
Ah ah ah ah ah ah trying to finesse
When you’re average at your best
And your average is a mess
I contest no competition
I got deadlines and decisions
I got practice and precision
I got victims in my vision now
Fuck it, I came to destroy
Point out the people who told you whatever
Each thing I spit get a mouthful of pepper
Ready and waiting and willing whenever
Eggshells all under my Jordans, egos all under my heels
Fuck you forever, you made me a monster, and all of the better to make you a meal
C’est la vie, c’est la savage, Im a savage, fuck it I’m feeling fantastic
Don’t give a damn bout the act or the actress
She can act out everything but the action
Trying to get it, you get it, get taxed
Trying to get it without any grants
Shoutout to Scarborough I stomp on my land
I’m a slap in the face with my hood in my hand

I was never playing at all
That’s why they never gave me the ball
But they know it
So they notice

VERSE 2

Ah ah ah ah ah they’ll be no further questions
No further interjections not financially invested
You can’t, can’t get my time with residuals not collected
I am bigger than denial, even if its a collective
Give a fuck if I’m respected fam, see how you respect shit fam
Loyalty so foreign, you do not know what respect is fam
The aforementioned fam, meet you in my mentions fam
Prevention so so hopeless, you blocked him and left me open fam
Fuck it, I came to deliver, theres nothing left for you fucks to consider
Chip on a shoulder could never be bigger
Adversity arsenal never been richer
Loss is a weapon of choice for a winner
Feature my flexing inside of your figures
Finger been itching for years on the trigger
When I get up in there I’m not gonna miss ya
Bhup bhup bhup bhup all you big dogs look like pup pups
I ain't worried I just puff puff, out it
Ya’ll just losers with new outfits
Sauce, drippin, bitches drownin’
You ain't louder, gotta ‘low it

You know where to find me

Money motivated, we be all about a salary
But fuck a bad economy and I ain't working hourly
Sour d smoke got me hungry, I'm devouring
Anybody who tryna get eaten like cauliflower
Beans, and I'm a hungry man nigga eat a salad
Aiming this .40 cali and hold taking your palace
Mad stylist, the Wu got me on some shaolin shit
Chk-chk BLOW! blood spilled in the chalices
Paper chase, push weight till palms gain catalysts
All day, everyday, the hood I be standing in
I ride by in an all grey Challenger
Petty possessions that motivated me 'round this shit
What up to Uncle J-Dawg, he locked down again
Next time a relly come out, we count thousands

I put a Vise Grip to all my vices, I just gotta have it
I gotta grab like a hand full of cash
To support that habit, I'm going rabbit for the cabbage
I out-lash, I'll kick yo ass just for the cash now
I hit the farms just to get myself a cash cow
They done got me assed out, black outs, a bad drought
I ain't made now cheese in six weeks
My connect been sleeping, I'm putting it to a beat on repeat
As real as the crib keeper that creeps through the streets
I'm just hoping I'll never meet my defeat
Same shit that I been saying all week
But this time I had to grab the Mossberg heat
With this rhyme if them niggas flip shine
It's almost like hitting his wrist or killing yaself
They got a hit out on my ego, I'm feeling myself

Ich freu mich, dass wir uns getroffen haben, welch ein schöner Ort
Nimm Platz und zieh's dir rein, danke für deinen ehrlichen Support
Echte Kunst hat Qualität, die Seele erkennt man meist gleich
Obwohl das schwer zu beschreiben ist, weißt du genau was gemeint ist
Schau dir das an, ich hab nie zu viel versprochen
Aus den Augen, aus der Welt, wir wollen uns fühlen wie neu geboren
Solang die Tage nicht den anderen gleichen, weiß ich das zu schätzen
Und warte auf die nächste Bahn, wenn sich die Leute da rein quetschen
Mit Detail-Liebe und Herz wird was gold glänzt überstrichen
Und dort wo wir hingeschwommen sind folgen die uns nicht hin
Sehen das ganze wie ein Brettspiel, in dem wir uns frei bewegen können
Mit einer einzigen Regel: Leben und leben lassen

[Hook]
Folg mir, wenn du magst, ich zieh dich ungern mit hinein
(Niemals!) Solltest du schon selber entscheiden, zazaza!
Die Welt ist schön, wenn du sie ganz genau so malst wie du sie magst

Ist schön, dass du dir Zeit nimmst, du hast sicher kaum davon
Doch dafür mit Sicherheit 'nen Haufen Kohlen aufm Konto
Gib die am besten mal aus, damit du siehst was du von haben kannst
Hauptsache ist, dass du genießt, bevor du in die Jahre kommst
Hau alles in den Pott, ey, vielleicht sind wir morgen tot
Auf meinem Grabstein soll mal stehen: Ich hab gelebt, wie es sich lohnt
Als kleiner Junge hat man mich versucht in Schablonen zu pressen
Für mich war von großem Interesse so vieles zu entdecken
Und ich bin froh, dass ich rappe, ein Dasein für die Kunst
Hau mein Sparschwein in hundert Stücke und fahre durch die Mitte
Verlass mich auf mein Glück, auf mein Pech konnte ich das immer
Ich bleib außer Konkurrenz, Sadi Anubis Zamunda

Em fotografias é o que nos valia e nos aquecia

Bancos e escolas fechados
Quando a cidade parou
Por causa da fúria de um deus
Que fez ainda pior

Surrounded by things, like a shadow in the light

Do I try and stay still for you
And the clowns who park here, emptiness of room
Do you watch me from the corner of your eye
Do we say goodbye?

I waited in the wings for you to appear

Wriggling my life how I'm wanting to live her life
So exhausting and downright haunting

And magic is what I gave to these lords and their ladies
Save me, I'm drowning within this tank

Free Shit,rap,Mathas,15.0,"[Intro: Mathas, Mathas & Mei Saraswåati]
We’ll take all the presents you can give us free of charge
Wrestle in the doorway to a mall this large
Put a price on anything, you’re gonna have to pay
Or sit around collecting coupons all day every day

[Verse 1: Mathas]
Yup, turned up at the door with a case, shovel ready suit and tie
Living on a lifetime high, collar with a hot steam iron
Digging though the baby’s mind with a matte of fine wires to map brain-science
Pliable playdough, young minds, inspire to accessorise
That lullaby livin’, colour code rhythm, lustin’ bliss out the box in a box
Your prey mate, your score, later-day saint you ain’t no more
Young baby, pudge and dimples, forehead prepped and tapped though the temple
Cuffed by the ankle, stuffed with a teddy bear, pull cords everywhere, mold ’em good
And that’s good right? Set for their whole life? For a few quick minutes of your time?
You’ll get that free shit first, you’ll keep those coins in your purse
Just let us study their face, just let us watch them play
For a few quick minutes with this toy, for a couple of weeks on each day
Timeline of a life form who buys up before their time goes flat
Gotta load up quick before it’s all gone, stock pile in a bunkered stash
You are only what you own, you can one day have it all
The playing field is level, keep kickin’ that pebble
[Chorus: Mathas & Mei Saraswåati, Mei Saraswåati]
All the free shit in the world will free your mind
All the free shit in the world will free your mind (Every, every, every)
All the free shit only free ‘bout half the time
All the free shit in the world will free your mind (Every, every day, every day)

Falling into the bargain bin

For free (For free)
Giving away

Edible prize and a wine pair course, groupon coupon smothered in sauce
Ram for that new screen, new tablet, Capulet family sweatshop meme
Free beer coaster, free toaster, gift wrap ghost a free-fished ocean
Free lotions and love potions invoke hope in the home so vocal
Endorsed by the silicon people, flawless, none born equal
Gods on billboards winking down, witches fitted with collagen crowns
Keep you in front of our mediums, eating your weeties in time with the jingle and single you out
For a limited time only, call now
This brochure knows you well, it held you as an infant
It knew vibrations only you could hear, those oldies missed it
You gave it its own name, pillared it’s importance
Kept you snuggled safe when all those closet monsters haunted
Sound and flash and fury, your best friend, judge and jury
Your brand, your club, your bud, your choice to broadcast every movement
The smell of gingerbread, the crumbs to lead you back with
The sack of goodies that we packed you for the ride

Thinking that a parent ain’t never fled/
Well you wrong/

Thinking that you gonna have a nice little life/
With no need for knife/
Have a wife/ and kids/
But you forgot about the lows/
Focused on the highs/
Didn’t think about any of the mids/
Slid head first/
With the first hearse/
And lost person/
First time really hurting/
First time something tragic happened/
Now pop pop ain’t getting those napkins/
When you really need them/
To combat the sadness/
And thoughts of the past/
Built you Castle/
Out of Crystals/

We looked around the open shore, waiting for something

This was to be our last ride
With steel guitar and the love you'd give me
Underneath the skin a feeling, a breakdown
Well, we sat for hours on the crimson sand
Exchanges in the currency of humans bought and sold
And the leaders seem to lose control
Shall we lose ourselves for a reason? Shall we burn ourselves for the answer?
Have we found the place that we're looking for?
Someone shouted, ""open the door"", look out!

2 bedroom apartment wit 6 people in it I thought it was dumb

Came up from crumbs

Did it all on my own

Like my mama wouldn't  home

Whole time she was there
Back then she ain’t care

I went through shit unprepared

But fuck it I know life it ain’t fair

I swear I was feeling like drake was
Cuz I can not fuck with no fake love
Build a strong foundation, no make up
Got it on my own, they was sleeping  had to wake up
Like rise and shine, so what’s mine is mine
Cuz I was on my own on my last dime
I’m from the slums where shit a get hectic
Niggas wear vest and still ain't protected
Fuck the day light niggas still getting blasted
Snitches get stitches since a younging it was mastered
I swear I can’t make this shit up
Growing n the slums man that shit was so tuff
I was taught knowing the streets was plus
It’s a must to not trust cuz that might get you bused
Shit
This ain’t nothing like movies
I would suggest for you to google it
Niggas dying over stupid shit
Real niggas know to get tf out
Real niggas not acting hood for no clout
Niggas really dying due to a drought

И очень, очень много, очень много новых дел
И как бы не плясал

Накинул новый патч

На куски In pieces,rap,DOORBELL,61.0,"[Verse 1]
Километры безмолвных тоннелей под огромным количеством снега
Освещенных чужим одобрением, в углу одного из кабинетов
В тяжеленном титановом сейфе, а внутри - бесконечная пропасть
На самом дне её крохотный ящик, вот именно там и лежит моя гордость
И ты снова заберешь часть меня с собой, я б не смог так играть с огнем
Разве это не безумие - собирать части паззла, что сам сотворил, проливая кровь?
Тут, за акрами счастья среди ста печальных историй
В океане лжи и предательств, вот именно там и найдешь мою совесть
По капиллярам и венам наивно шагая в попытках найти что-то важное
Нечто вмещающее все отрывки из сновидений темных до безобразия
Каждый порок, миллионы недосказанных слов, и глубины черного детства
Ну вот ты здесь, и что теперь? Что? Ты думала, тут лежит мое сердце?
Тут лежит мое сердце?

[Hook x2]
Раздели меня на куски, изучай меня по частям
Загляни в мой крохотный мир, и прочти меня до конца
Разбери меня от и до, но всего тебе не найти
Вспомни, что похоже на боль и раздели меня на куски
[Verse 2]
Столько попыток впустую потерянных, тут ни найти тебе ничего светлого
На пустынной лунной поверхности, титанической злобой растерзанной
Поиск свернется раньше, чем хочется, руки опустятся, ничего нового
Ткни наугад и окажешься среди руин глубоко затонувшего города
В котором пусто, туман, тебе ничего не видно, сгустки добра ты без устали ищешь
Но трудно насытиться пустотой и только это не дает взять и остановиться
Стаканы дешевого пойла в количестве N сохраняют огонь внутри
Хрупкого тела, а как же еще ему вытерпеть томные взгляды покойника, а?
Это самый безумный самообман
На пути от горячих объятий до мертвого холода
Даты исчерпаны, нечего вспоминать
К вечеру обязательно и ты будешь разобрана

[Hook x2]
Раздели меня на куски, изучай меня по частям

Returning sadly from a very pleasant holiday
Just then the starry night
Is filled with blinding light

They'd never seen a greater sight

Who every Christmas gets a special kind of present

And fight for what you know
And say what you think

Just promise me one thing
Please know your heart before you begin to sing

'Cause I'm on my way back home
And I found that the story was true all along

There’s this song in my head it keeps circling the same phrase
But  I can’t seem to write down the words I’m supposed to say
I’ll  find someone else to be alive
So I can give this up

I  keep pacing the halls wondering if it means anything
Each  step cuts through my open mind
In words I should have sung

So  give me flight
Give me younger nights
I’ll build a basement cut from time
Where I’ll scream until I build a life

Все тянут неизбежное,как лямку бурлаки
Попрежнему безденежье - диктует,кто есть мы
Невежлив будто здешние,далёк от мишуры
Меня никто не держит,но я словно взаперти
От атомных привычек смертоносного охвата,до беспомощных попыток ограничиться стаканом
Я зомбирован,как Ирод и не выгляжу,как надо
В этом мире проще с гидом,но в моём кармане карта
Что ты знаешь о местах,где пропадают даже звери?
И буквально каждый шаг - уже заведомо последний

Накрыло запустение,как ледяная дрожь
Сыграл ва-банк со временем,осталась только ночь
Но никуда не деться мне,вплоть до метаморфоз
Здесь тесно,как в Освенциме - все строки под откос
И всё время где-то между:то ни небо,ни земля

My blue cloak will cling round me like the night
I will clasp your head to my bosom;
And there in the sweet loneliness
Murmur on your heart
I will shut my eyes and listen
I will not look in your face
When your words are ended
We will sit still and silent
Only the trees will whisper in the dark
The night will pale
The day will dawn
We shall look at each other's eyes

Dried Coffee Beans,rap,Teef Sweat,40.0,"      We used to be cruisin through traffic
Then it went to bein ruthless with
Blunt passes
Tricks on lock, goin to find new spots
The only beef we got was from the
Cops
Ridin' miles just to get to the park
Skatin all day, spittin' fire after
Dark
That was the routine, before I blew rings
Then everything changed after I got
Into new things
Wastin time on dimes, & cuttin ties
With homies that used to ride, &
We used to grind
Then I flipped sides, to the middle like primo
Started looking behind, to the
Back like Ringo
Saw everyone change from the get
Now I wish I would've never passed the
Spliff
When I did, personalities went & changed up
Now we can't even relate on
The same stuff
Now, half my homies are grads
I see in a year, ill be walking that path
Gown & a cap, or a frown & a flask
Cause I see that my past, is down
Like the mats
But what will the future withhold?
Hopefully somethin fresh, gained by
Mentos
Cause I don't wanna get old, reminded that
High School was the best, as
Provided fact
Used to plan until I learned the unexpected
Was earth's way of making a
Contraceptive
At least I ain't got kids or doin a bid
Or movin some bricks, to buy my own
Kicks
The old days are nonexistent
I stayed the same cause I ain't kickflippin'
Used to go where I please, now I ask permission
Every day used to feel like a
New edition

Where has the time gone? I was once a child
Who believed the lies long &
Looked at the bible
Who loved his momma more than rap verse recitals
Who went to comic stores
& didn't know of crack vials
Who wrote to no beats, now he's makin his own
Never had cold feet, shouldered stayin alone
Playin the station, like it was Pelham in the 80's
Listening to breaks, by Yella & Shady
Makin Mixes, of Public Enemy & Tribe
On the fences, he could always Rely
On the expression, when his dad never
Left them

Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
See, I'm one of a kind
There's a brain behind all these different wonderful rhymes
And peoples livin' in the past 'cause they runnin' from time (Uh)
Seems like so long since Big Punisher died
Hope he see me when I'm lookin' up from under the sky (Yup)
I'ma tell you how it is 'cause I got nothin' to hide
And Soul Theory makes the beats that'll bump in the ride (Uh-huh)
This criminal lifestyle that I'm jumpin' inside
A mastermind, superb with both sides of his brain
Roll me up into a Swisher, start flyin' away
But ash my soul, rub the L on the side of the tray
'Cause it's hard lookin' up, like the sky when it rains (Uh-huh)
Smokin' strains that levitate me like David Blaine
I'm a player and you hatin' on my game
Say my name, 'cause this here's my destiny, child
Now all this stress is off of my chest, I can rest for a while

Got me feelin' so, feelin' so, with this blunt of my mind

And I shall not (Uh-huh), hold thy tongue
So I'ma speak 'til I fold my gums
I was told to run (Run), 'cause every day is a colder one
I wake up not knowin' if I'm old or young
I can't (Can't), find my place so I lay upon these beats (Beats)
Coverin' my pain with layers of melodic sheets (Uh-huh)
Mother Earth's a bitch, so when kingdom come
We gon' bring 'em some 'til thy will be done
And still to come is when I'm finally driven to insanity
By my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me
My knees are shakin', see, I'm not able to stand
'Cause they label a man by his paper in hand
Sittin' in a dark alley with some paper and pens
Writin', just thinkin' when this day's gon' end
What can you say to a man who can't look at himself
When the image in the mirror keeps on yellin' for help? (Uh-huh)

Spittin' got me smitten, no excuses for the lovin' (Uh)
I'm tryna get it written but I'm comin' up with nothin'
A couple words in each line filled with somethin', somethin', somethings (Uh-huh)
And to me, hip-hop ain't got a criminal past
It's just explosions of sounds as these syllables clash
Brain on critical mass (Yup), fuck political trash (Yup)
These politicians speakin', but it's comin' out they ass
Talkin' bout ""School is cool"" and ""Drugs is for thugs""
Tryna push me down a path, but I shall not budge
'Cause I've been thinkin' and I think I have a hunch
Who hand the mic to get enough
While me and music makin' love
And my community ain't all about who I choose to be
This life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities
This figurative language that I'm speakin' so fluently
Look back like a photo album, seein' who I used to be (Chyeah)
Playin' piano and I'm strummin' guitar
Can't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin' to Mars
Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car (Uh-huh)
It ain't everybody hatin', but enough of you are

Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax

And everyone is still screaming it at me
Wake up for work oh no you're late again
But it's all good cause I was there in sleep
But I can't sleep from just two hours of
Nightmares eternal and dreaming was just a thing
I just want some rest so I can feel good again
To start the day over, and say that I'm blessed again
And all that i want is to share someone with my bed
But that's never happened, and it never will again
Cause i'm all alone, and my dreams are keeping me
So i'll go back and wake up in five minutes

But the foam in the mattress is screaming with demons
I can't find the words to say that i'm leaving, but i'm burning down this creaky old house
And i'm going where I can finally find myself",0.6849972791969776,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tribute To Rap,rap,Medium,260.0,"[Zwrotka]
Zasypiałem przy tobie i budziłem się
Krzyk i szept, łzy i śmiech, sukces, upadek
Każdy ranek tlił ogień by podziwiać Cię
Repeater, bit i tekst, wkrótce nagranie
Próżne błaganie odrzucałaś jak nie swoje, bowiem
Ludzie fatalnie wyznawali kakofonie w Polsce
Przyjąłem Cię z bagażem, dałem schronienie przecież
Wyniosłem z Ciebie pasje, dałaś mi więcej
Kocham Ci śpiewać „Love of My Life”
Wiesz, jak słuchasz cierpliwie
Ubarwiasz życie, wśród nas masz immunitet
Hip-Hop religią, miłość ma tylko jedno imię
Sprawca przesileń, działasz cyklicznie, kwitniesz
Cyfrowe linie, wyłącznie wydźwięk liter
Nie odjęłaś mi mowy, lecz dodałaś wiarę
Nie dzieliłem Cię obcym, więc pomnóż mój talent


[Zwrotka]
Jeśli któregoś dnia nie podniosę powiek - włącz play
Przewin ""Któregoś dnia"" na początek zwrotek. Możesz?
I poczuj się jak byłbym tuż obok, z Tobą krok w krok
Uspokój oddech i czuj moją wolność
Zabierz mnie w słuchawkach bym poczuł zapach miasta
Tam, gdzie tlen oplata dym, poczuj lata starań
Pokaż mi miejsca, gdzie sławiłem Twoje imię dla was
Pokaż im miejsca, gdzie wyryłem Twe oblicze, błagam
Gdy noc przykryje mnie całunem śmierci
Całuję księżyc lekki oddech, przytul do piersi
Dłonie, przywróć tą parabolę wspomnień o mnie
Potem na koniec mogę spokojnie odejść z honorem
Jesteś numerem jeden, przyjacielem
Pozwalasz mi być nieśmiertelnym echem
W przeddzień zupełnie wlecę w atmosferę
I dla niej zwolnię Ziemię tym bezpiecznym tempem

Baby why don'tcha, honey why won'tcha
Accept the fact that it's not just the knack
That I care? So please let me share
Special moments, moments so rare
Check it out, if I could give you the world, you know I'd do it
Everything at your feet, ain't nothin to it
But it's hard sweetheart, and it's rough out here
But I doubt there, is anybody else for me

Mmm the things I feel, they are for real
I'm past the point of dwellin, on the sex appeal
Mad chicks sweat me, but I desire your womanness
Dude sweats you, but I'm the best
Listen, we could build a future together
No doll and I would never soup you ever, never
I'm buggin out, over the thought of you leavin
Tried to step to you, but now you're retreatin

So now you know the flavor
It's not about the stuff I gave ya
And my behavior is based on strong
Feelings I have, of you and me, it's like a bond
A treasure, not to be corny but word
I wanna give you all the joy that you deserve
I know we argue, sometimes I start to annoy you
But we should never ever, try to destroy two
Hearts joined, intertwined with a passion
Give me a chance love, that's all I'm askin
And furthermore, you can be sure that I'll do
Every little thing you need, yes it's true
I'm not desperate, but I'm the one for you

[Chorus: N'Dea]
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you

Mira nene, veme frotar
Mira nene, veme tocar

Rain dries in the morning I be outside
Takin' showers till I'm yawnin' hope you don’t mind
No silence, man nothing but more violence
I'm hoping to god that all of my homies just keep climbing
Fuck all that beef shit, we vegan don’t eat gossip
'Cause half of the world be postin' and half of them leave comments
Honestly what are you?
Been switching between the too
Theirs evil up in my city, I’m wondering if it’s you
The colors be runnin' shit, and they runnin' all over you
Like a bruise in your city, black almost always will come with blue
They fighting the odds
Shuffle the cards
Lookin' for god up in ya bra
I know we got problems, just shake em off
Give all of my time to fly
Just to see my homies take off
This our season comin' drippin' with the sauce

I been waitin' for awhile but I’m still climbin' it’s vivid
I gotta get it make it mine, poppin' like grease in the skillet
You got an issue, bitch you bet you can bend over and stick it

Tired of all the cries
You tried to apologize but I see past the the fake facade
You worshipin' all these models on Instagram like they gods
And I come through drippin' with sauce on the fries

Alright now everybody just relax
Recline yo seat back
That paranoia you can keep that
Keep on your feet clean that dirt off of your kneecaps
And even if you gotta fall back just pick up where you leave at
Rest in paradise Nip 'cause that shit got me on edge
All that positivity and they still wanted him dead
All that paranoia shit is probably all in my head
But you ain't step in my shoes, nah you ain't walk with my legs
You can't imagine all potholes I hit on the road
You can't imagine all the crazy shit I've been through before

After you learn your lesson from it, gotta let that shit go

And somehow she gets you
Said that you loved me, but we didn't match up

Got me wrapped up, you knew I wouldn't leave you
Did shit that you knew I wouldn't do to you

Ain't nobody perfect ain't nobody worth it
But God gave us purpose

Look in the mirror get delivered cause we made in his image
Fruits of labor reaching goals while you squeeze Life's lemons
Optimistic my position don't believe in Life's limits
Statute to limitations given cause my pigment
But I'm off my Pivot taking proper steps to ball
People praise you when you got it then they laugh when you fall
But you a winner/winter spring back and you stunting in the summer
Took a reciprocal flip doing numbers got them under
I Wonder if it's only whites seeing bread
Cause we ain't eating with the pigs and we tired of the feds
But we free not locked it's so funny that they dread
I'm the one they Dread like Scott from the head
At the top never led no I ain't never Number 2
But they gotta take a second I'm a blessing
Like a reverend teaching lessons

Tryna cope with being Lesser getting lesser
But I'm Praying for the better

Be natural and candid

Veni vidi vici
I'm feeling like young da Vinci
Use the pen as a paint brush
My life a canvas that's empty
Better yet a mosaic my broken pieces of being eventually turned to be the thesis of what I been dreaming
Close my eyes and see a scene
Straight out of a movie
Lend your like Van Goh and vicariously through these
Words I throw on paper hopefully you'll get the picture try and depict the purpose of every move that I make
The feeble won't get the message
To the thinkers it's probably see through daring as canivale with an easel in hand I know that God got a plan
To make sure that I make it
So I paint with the greatness of an artisan
This something I don't expect y'all to understand really
To you it might seem silly but every stroke of the brush has purpose
I know that soon it'll surface change your perspective you'll notice that this is much more than abstract",0.4370545744895935,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the womb to the tomb
Yearning for peace day by day
Hiding in dreams, it's the only way

Are you blind?

Een Huis Is Nog Geen Thuis A House Is Not A Home,pop,Corry Brokken,41.0,"Een deur is maar een deur

Ook al is hij gouden bergen waard
Hij verwarmt dan wel jouw huis
Maar dat huis is nog geen thuis
Zonder iemand die je hand verwarmt
En jou steeds weer bij die haard omarmt

Wat dreef ons ooit uit elkaar
Als dorre blaren in de wind
Was er dan ooit van toen (??)
Waren wij niet ziende blind

Is er, goed beschouwd
Werkelijk iets wat ons gescheiden houdt
Nu draagt elk van ons een kruis
Maar dit huis zal nooit een thuis voor een ander zijn

The Middle School,pop,Brccke,2.0,"They tore down the middle school
I never liked it anyway
But I still thought they would talk to me first
Go back to grade 7 and
Throw all my cares away
Feels like I'm living in reverse

Look back at history
Just like before
When all of my thoughts were just
Given a score
Well now I'm alone and I'm
Dreaming of more
But it still feels like living in reverse

And I don’t know how it all ended up this way
But I won’t go on remembering every mistake

With rose coloured glasses

And smoke fills the room

Lay on the pavement, look up at the clouds
I'd drift but my thoughts all keep running aground
So turn up the volume to block out the sound
And I swear to god I can hear better

A rabbit inside of a hat when rapping or am I actually gifted

I went out walking through the streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in

I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

I went out with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went out walking
Down that winding road
Where no one's trusting no one
And conscience a too heavy load
I went out riding, down that ol'eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there, too
Looking for you
I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel's as much
As a man can before he repents
I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who could sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yea I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon
Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you

Welcome Home,rap,Rasul,67.0,"That’s what it sounds like when you're standing at the pearly gates:
When a man’s whispering a simple phrase like
""I miss home"" - though his home's been a cage
Land of the free and asylum for the brave
In an ocean of denial, dog-paddling 'gainst the waves
Drowning in guilt, doubt and sick rage
Escapades of a peon, I'm mohammed in the cave (talk to me)
Misconstrued, misled, misbehaved
Keep running into walls like my name is Willie Mays
So here i am putting misery to the page
The serenades of a hanging slave
Depraved dialogues with the spirit of isaac hayes
Telling god I'm on my way tipsy off that E&J
Trying to find an ortofon needle in the haystacks
Of Sly Stone 8-tracks on replay
I deejay broken records of lies and clichés
Wonder if y'all wanna hear what i really have to say
Welcome home

[Chorus: Hila Bronstein]
At the end of the rainbow
In a world of his own
Now the angels keep calling
Welcome home
Demons remain faithful
To the pain that he holds
When the angels keep calling
Welcome home
To the rhythms of solitude
The DNA of fresh trapped in my molecules
I'm Johnny Cool Rasul Ishmael
Power rule from the school of hard lucks and troubled moods
Ever since looking up through that infamous Hollis crew
Pete Rock, C.L. Smooth, Live At The BBQ, that
I want my 40 acres and a mule
The fuel flushing our veins when Kane was dropping jewels
Forgotten loops chopped and screwed with proper tools
Those sonic grooves that make your stomach move
Word-play's equivalent to Rubik's demonic cube
Colourful puzzles for church girls, pimps and college dudes
Whoever might understand the struggle too
Shelter tomorrow’s youth with clothes and solid food
The pursuit of happiness is the pursuit for Ws
Who better compare it to than the Mavericks' number 2?
Welcome home

[Chorus: Hila Bronstein]
At the end of the rainbow
In a world of his own
Now the angels keep calling
Welcome home
Demons remain faithful
To the pain that he holds
When the angels keep calling
Welcome home
Cause when a man's whispers are simply rephrased like
Aaron Hall used to sing ""Don't Be Afraid""
On a stage I'm Mumia trapped in an iron maze
Renegade, maniac writing for better days
Forever dazed
Since you mind sprays a gift of gab and your dad calls it a phase
Raised among black pots, white lines and razor blades
Where crime pays to pave a peasant's ways
Where seeds of wisdom never blossom with age
What you've done, seen, or heard are your company for the grave
And damn right the boy has changed
Your boy's Germane, dying slowly inside from the joy's of pain
While you keep mistaken my poise for strange
Ask yourself: when will you hear this voice again?
While you keep mistaking this coy for strange ask yourself
When you might hear this voice again – welcome home

[Chorus: Hila Bronstein]
At the end of the rainbow
In a world of his own
Now the angels keep calling
Welcome home
Demons remain faithful
To the pain that he holds
When the angels keep calling
Welcome home
Welcome home
Welcome home
Welcome home
Welcome home

How Young Thug’s ‘JEFFERY’ Cover Changed His Career,misc,tonymontana,194.0,"The epochal and controversial JEFFERY album cover continues to be a defining image in Young Thug’s career.When Jeffery Lamar Williams, artistically known as Young Thug, teased his No, My Name is Jeffery mixtape, fans were prepared for the unexpected. In an interview with Beats 1, Thug detailed the new sound which would come out of this era as “straight crossover,” and by gearing up for a professional name switch to simply Jeffery, the ever-unpredictable Thugger was setting the stage for something massive. It came together in the form of JEFFERY, Thug’s most extravagant and spectacular mixtape yet.

While the tracklist to JEFFERY shows tributes to his idols, from everyone from Rihanna (stylized as “RiRi”) to Harambe, the western lowland gorilla killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in May of 2016, the cover art remains the most captivating, unique, and essential aspect of the album. In the most unexpected move of his entire career, Thug dressed in drag with a blue and white dress from Italian designer Alessandro Trincone. Naturally, this attracted all eyes in the trap music scene as well as pop culture in general, as it differs drastically from previous Thugger imagery which included cartoons such as Slime Season 3 and I’m Up as well as grimy cover arts such as Barter 6 and I Came from Nothing 2.

The surprise of Thug’s cover has led to massive revelations in his career, for better or for worse. As the four year anniversary of JEFFERY approaches on August 26, 2020, here are the most drastic changes to his career since then, as a direct result of the dress.

Personal
Since the art, Young Thug has been questioned about the dress on multiple occasions. The most interesting update came in a July 2019 No Jumper interview where Thug claimed that he stowed a large AK-47 assault rifle underneath it. Thug further touched on this in his track “Just How It Is” in August 2019:Had to wear the dress 'cause I had a stick
You know where the bag at, tell me where it isBeef
Following the release of the cover art, Thug faced massive criticisms from other rappers under the claims that he was homosexual, and that his androgynous style of dress was negative to the culture. Nicki Minaj poked fun at Thug on her August 2018 “Barbie Dreams,” where she exaggerated that Jeffery was raiding her closet and making off with some of her dresses. Most notable of his opponents originated from YFN Lucci, who has sneak dissed Thug in lyrics following the release of JEFFERY, insinuating that Thugger “ain't no man” on his March 2018 track “At My Best.” In addition, following the release of Young Thug’s June 2017 BEAUTIFUL THUGGER GIRLS, Lucci took to Twitter to belittle Jeffery:Influence
As far as hip-hop and gender roles go, Thugger was certainly not the first to gown in untraditional attire, as the first instances of the unique style can be drawn back to the early 1990s with André 3000’s unorthodox style of dress. However, overlooking Thug’s impact on the uniqueness of style in rap would be a grave mistake. Thugger has also expressed support for artists like Lil Nas X for coming out as LGBTQ+ and connections have been drawn between Bad Bunny’s February 2020 “Yo Perreo Sola” music video, where the Latin Trap king donned drag as well.

Thug’s JEFFERY cover shocked the world to its core and remnants of his outfit still remain a vital part of Thugger’s identity, style, relationships with other artists, and most importantly, his legacy. The world may never get another rapper fashion visionary on Young Thug’s level, but hopefully, his strides made and the fight against his backlash will make it more comfortable for similar imaginative artists to pursue careers.",0.6103872346575372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ll do anything for you
Please say yes
You are the one that I want nothing more, nothing less

You beg to differ, I can see you shiver
Tryna flee but all you do is flicker
You need to relax, I can give you a liquor
You must swim in it with a pair of flippers
You need to prove me that you are a keeper

Aarons Rod Chap. 2,misc,D. H. Lawrence,4.0,"Royal Oak

The war had killed the little market of the town. As he passed the market place on the brow, Aaron noticed that there were only two miserable stalls. But people crowded just the same. There was a loud sound of voices, men's voices. Men pressed round the doorways of the public-houses.

But he was going to a pub out of town. He descended the dark hill. A street-lamp here and there shed parsimonious light. In the bottoms, under the trees, it was very dark. But a lamp glimmered in front of the “Royal Oak.” This was a low white house sunk three steps below the highway. It was darkened, but sounded crowded.

Opening the door, Sisson found himself in the stone passage. Old Bob, carrying three cans, stopped to see who had entered—then went on into the public bar on the left. The bar itself was a sort of little window-sill on the right: the pub was a small one. In this window-opening stood the landlady, drawing and serving to her husband. Behind the bar was a tiny parlour or den, the landlady's preserve.

“Oh, it's you,” she said, bobbing down to look at the newcomer. None entered her bar-parlour unless invited.

“Come in,” said the landlady. There was a peculiar intonation in her complacent voice, which showed she had been expecting him, a little irritably.

He went across into her bar-parlour. It would not hold more than eight or ten people, all told—just the benches along the walls, the fire between—and two little round tables.

“I began to think you weren't coming,” said the landlady, bringing him a whiskey.

She was a large, stout, high-coloured woman, with a fine profile, probably Jewish. She had chestnut-coloured eyes, quick, intelligent. Her movements were large and slow, her voice laconic.

“I'm not so late, am I?” asked Aaron.

“Yes, you are late, I should think.” She Looked up at the little clock. “Close on nine.”

“I did some shopping,” said Aaron, with a quick smile.

“Did you indeed? That's news, I'm sure. May we ask what you bought?”

This he did not like. But he had to answer.

“Christmas-tree candles, and toffee.”

“For the little children? Well you've done well for once! I must say I recommend you. I didn't think you had so much in you.”

She sat herself down in her seat at the end of the bench, and took up her knitting. Aaron sat next to her. He poured water into his glass, and drank.

“It's warm in here,” he said, when he had swallowed the liquor.

“Yes, it is. You won't want to keep that thick good overcoat on,” replied the landlady.

“No,” he said, “I think I'll take it off.”

She watched him as he hung up his overcoat. He wore black clothes, as usual. As he reached up to the pegs, she could see the muscles of his shoulders, and the form of his legs. Her reddish-brown eyes seemed to burn, and her nose, that had a subtle, beautiful Hebraic curve, seemed to arch itself. She made a little place for him by herself, as he returned. She carried her head thrown back, with dauntless self-sufficiency.

There were several colliers in the room, talking quietly. They were the superior type all, favoured by the landlady, who loved intellectual discussion. Opposite, by the fire, sat a little, greenish man—evidently an oriental.

“You're very quiet all at once, Doctor,” said the landlady in her slow, laconic voice.

“Yes.—May I have another whiskey, please?” She rose at once, powerfully energetic.
“Oh, I'm sorry,” she said. And she went to the bar.

“Well,” said the little Hindu doctor, “and how are things going now, with the men?”

“The same as ever,” said Aaron.

“Yes,” said the stately voice of the landlady. “And I'm afraid they will always be the same as ever. When will they learn wisdom?”

“But what do you call wisdom?” asked Sherardy, the Hindu. He spoke with a little, childish lisp.

“What do I call wisdom?” repeated the landlady. “Why all acting together for the common good. That is wisdom in my idea.”

“Yes, very well, that is so. But what do you call the common good?” replied the little doctor, with childish pertinence.

“Ay,” said Aaron, with a laugh, “that's it.” The miners were all stirring now, to take part in the discussion.

“What do I call the common good?” repeated the landlady. “That all people should study the welfare of other people, and not only their own.”

“They are not to study their own welfare?” said the doctor.

“Ah, that I did not say,” replied the landlady. “Let them study their own welfare, and that of others also.”

“Well then,” said the doctor, “what is the welfare of a collier?”

“The welfare of a collier,” said the landlady, “is that he shall earn sufficient wages to keep himself and his family comfortable, to educate his children, and to educate himself; for that is what he wants, education.”
“Ay, happen so,” put in Brewitt, a big, fine, good-humoured collier. “Happen so, Mrs. Houseley. But what if you haven't got much education, to speak of?”

“You can always get it,” she said patronizing.

“Nay—I'm blest if you can. It's no use tryin' to educate a man over forty—not by book-learning. That isn't saying he's a fool, neither.”

“And what better is them that's got education?” put in another man. “What better is the manager, or th' under-manager, than we are?—Pender's yaller enough i' th' face.”

“He is that,” assented the men in chorus.

“But because he's yellow in the face, as you say, Mr. Kirk,” said the landlady largely, “that doesn't mean he has no advantages higher than what you have got.”

“Ay,” said Kirk. “He can ma'e more money than I can—that's about a' as it comes to.”

“He can make more money,” said the landlady. “And when he's made it, he knows better how to use it.”

“'Appen so, an' a'!—What does he do, more than eat and drink and work?—an' take it out of hisself a sight harder than I do, by th' looks of him.—What's it matter, if he eats a bit more or drinks a bit more—”

“No,” reiterated the landlady. “He not only eats and drinks. He can read, and he can converse.”

“Me an' a',” said Tom Kirk, and the men burst into a laugh. “I can read—an' I've had many a talk an' conversation with you in this house, Mrs. Houseley—am havin' one at this minute, seemingly.”

“SEEMINGLY, you are,” said the landlady ironically. “But do you think there would be no difference between your conversation, and Mr. Pender's, if he were here so that I could enjoy his conversation?”

“An' what difference would there be?” asked Tom Kirk. “He'd go home to his bed just the same.”

“There, you are mistaken. He would be the better, and so should I, a great deal better, for a little genuine conversation.”

“If it's conversation as ma'es his behind drop—” said Tom Kirk. “An' puts th' bile in his face—” said Brewitt. There was a general laugh.

“I can see it's no use talking about it any further,” said the landlady, lifting her head dangerously.

“But look here, Mrs. Houseley, do you really think it makes much difference to a man, whether he can hold a serious conversation or not?” asked the doctor.

“I do indeed, all the difference in the world—To me, there is no greater difference, than between an educated man and an uneducated man.”

“And where does it come in?” asked Kirk.

“But wait a bit, now,” said Aaron Sisson. “You take an educated man—take Pender. What's his education for? What does he scheme for?—What does he contrive for? What does he talk for?—”

“For all the purposes of his life,” replied the landlady.

“Ay, an' what's the purpose of his life?” insisted Aaron Sisson.

“The purpose of his life,” repeated the landlady, at a loss. “I should think he knows that best himself.”

“No better than I know it—and you know it,” said Aaron.

“Well,” said the landlady, “if you know, then speak out. What is it?”

“To make more money for the firm—and so make his own chance of a rise better.”
The landlady was baffled for some moments. Then she said:

“Yes, and suppose that he does. Is there any harm in it? Isn't it his duty to do what he can for himself? Don't you try to earn all you can?”

“Ay,” said Aaron. “But there's soon a limit to what I can earn.—It's like this. When you work it out, everything comes to money. Reckon it as you like, it's money on both sides. It's money we live for, and money is what our lives is worth—nothing else. Money we live for, and money we are when we're dead: that or nothing. An' it's money as is between the masters and us. There's a few educated ones got hold of one end of the rope, and all the lot of us hanging on to th' other end, an' we s'll go on pulling our guts out, time in, time out—”

“But they've got th' long end o' th' rope, th' masters has,” said Brewitt.

“For as long as one holds, the other will pull,” concluded Aaron Sisson philosophically.

“An' I'm almighty sure o' that,” said Kirk. There was a little pause.

“Yes, that's all there is in the minds of you men,” said the landlady. “But what can be done with the money, that you never think of—the education of the children, the improvement of conditions—”

“Educate the children, so that they can lay hold of the long end of the rope, instead of the short end,” said the doctor, with a little giggle.

“Ay, that's it,” said Brewitt. “I've pulled at th' short end, an' my lads may do th' same.”

“A selfish policy,” put in the landlady.

“Selfish or not, they may do it.”

“Till the crack o' doom,” said Aaron, with a glistening smile.

“Or the crack o' th' rope,” said Brewitt.

“Yes, and THEN WHAT?” cried the landlady.

“Then we all drop on our backsides,” said Kirk. There was a general laugh, and an uneasy silence.

“All I can say of you men,” said the landlady, “is that you have a narrow, selfish policy.—Instead of thinking of the children, instead of thinking of improving the world you live in—”

“We hang on, British bulldog breed,” said Brewitt. There was a general laugh.

“Yes, and little wiser than dogs, wrangling for a bone,” said the landlady.

“Are we to let t' other side run off wi' th' bone, then, while we sit on our stunts an' yowl for it?” asked Brewitt.

“No indeed. There can be wisdom in everything.—It's what you DO with the money, when you've got it,” said the landlady, “that's where the importance lies.”

“It's Missis as gets it,” said Kirk. “It doesn't stop wi' us.” “Ay, it's the wife as gets it, ninety per cent,” they all concurred.

“And who SHOULD have the money, indeed, if not your wives? They have everything to do with the money. What idea have you, but to waste it!”
“Women waste nothing—they couldn't if they tried,” said Aaron Sisson.

There was a lull for some minutes. The men were all stimulated by drink. The landlady kept them going. She herself sipped a glass of brandy—but slowly. She sat near to Sisson—and the great fierce warmth of her presence enveloped him particularly. He loved so to luxuriate, like a cat, in the presence of a violent woman. He knew that tonight she was feeling very nice to him—a female glow that came out of her to him. Sometimes when she put down her knitting, or took it up again from the bench beside him, her fingers just touched his thigh, and the fine electricity ran over his body, as if he were a cat tingling at a caress.

And yet he was not happy—nor comfortable. There was a hard, opposing core in him, that neither the whiskey nor the woman could dissolve or soothe, tonight. It remained hard, nay, became harder and more deeply antagonistic to his surroundings, every moment. He recognised it as a secret malady he suffered from: this strained, unacknowledged opposition to his surroundings, a hard core of irrational, exhausting withholding of himself. Irritating, because he still WANTED to give himself. A woman and whiskey, these were usually a remedy—and music. But lately these had begun to fail him. No, there was something in him that would not give in—neither to the whiskey, nor the woman, nor even the music. Even in the midst of his best music, it sat in the middle of him, this invisible black dog, and growled and waited, never to be cajoled. He knew of its presence—and was a little uneasy. For of course he wanted to let himself go, to feel rosy and loving and all that. But at the very thought, the black dog showed its teeth.

Still he kept the beast at bay—with all his will he kept himself as it were genial. He wanted to melt and be rosy, happy.

He sipped his whiskey with gratification, he luxuriated in the presence of the landlady, very confident of the strength of her liking for him. He glanced at her profile—that fine throw-back of her hostile head, wicked in the midst of her benevolence; that subtle, really very beautiful delicate curve of her nose, that moved him exactly like a piece of pure sound. But tonight it did not overcome him. There was a devilish little cold eye in his brain that was not taken in by what he saw.

A terrible obstinacy located itself in him. He saw the fine, rich-coloured, secretive face of the Hebrew woman, so loudly self-righteous, and so dangerous, so destructive, so lustful—and he waited for his blood to melt with passion for her. But not tonight. Tonight his innermost heart was hard and cold as ice. The very danger and lustfulness of her, which had so pricked his senses, now made him colder. He disliked her at her tricks. He saw her once too often. Her and all women. Bah, the love game! And the whiskey that was to help in the game! He had drowned himself once too often in whiskey and in love. Now he floated like a corpse in both, with a cold, hostile eye.

And at least half of his inward fume was anger because he could no longer drown. Nothing would have pleased him better than to feel his senses melting and swimming into oneness with the dark. But impossible! Cold, with a white fury inside him, he floated wide eyed and apart as a corpse. He thought of the gentle love of his first married years, and became only whiter and colder, set in more intense obstinacy. A wave of revulsion lifted him.

He became aware that he was deadly antagonistic to the landlady, that he disliked his whole circumstances. A cold, diabolical consciousness detached itself from his state of semi-intoxication.

“Is it pretty much the same out there in India?” he asked of the doctor, suddenly.

The doctor started, and attended to him on his own level.

“Probably,” he answered. “It is worse.”

“Worse!” exclaimed Aaron Sisson. “How's that?”

“Why, because, in a way the people of India have an easier time even than the people of England. Because they have no responsibility. The British Government takes the responsibility. And the people have nothing to do, except their bit of work—and talk perhaps about national rule, just for a pastime.”

“They have to earn their living?” said Sisson.

“Yes,” said the little doctor, who had lived for some years among the colliers, and become quite familiar with them. “Yes, they have to earn their living—and then no more. That's why the British Government is the worst thing possible for them. It is the worst thing possible. And not because it is a bad government. Really, it is not a bad government. It is a good one—and they know it—much better than they would make for themselves, probably. But for that reason it is so very bad.”

The little oriental laughed a queer, sniggering laugh. His eyes were very bright, dilated, completely black. He was looking into the ice-blue, pointed eyes of Aaron Sisson. They were both intoxicated—but grimly so. They looked at each other in elemental difference.

The whole room was now attending to this new conversation: which they all accepted as serious. For Aaron was considered a special man, a man of peculiar understanding, even though as a rule he said little.
“If it is a good government, doctor, how can it be so bad for the people?” said the landlady.

The doctor's eyes quivered for the fraction of a second, as he watched the other man. He did not look at the landlady.

“It would not matter what kind of mess they made—and they would make a mess, if they governed themselves, the people of India. They would probably make the greatest muddle possible—and start killing one another. But it wouldn't matter if they exterminated half the population, so long as they did it themselves, and were responsible for it.”

Again his eyes dilated, utterly black, to the eyes of the other man, and an arch little smile flickered on his face.

“I think it would matter very much indeed,” said the landlady. “They had far better NOT govern themselves.”

She was, for some reason, becoming angry. The little greenish doctor emptied his glass, and smiled again.

“But what difference does it make,” said Aaron Sisson, “whether they govern themselves or not? They only live till they die, either way.” And he smiled faintly. He had not really listened to the doctor. The terms “British Government,” and “bad for the people—good for the people,” made him malevolently angry.

The doctor was nonplussed for a moment. Then he gathered himself together.

“It matters,” he said; “it matters.—People should always be responsible for themselves. How can any people be responsible for another race of people, and for a race much older than they are, and not at all children.”

Aaron Sisson watched the other's dark face, with its utterly exposed eyes. He was in a state of semi-intoxicated anger and clairvoyance. He saw in the black, void, glistening eyes of the oriental only the same danger, the same menace that he saw in the landlady. Fair, wise, even benevolent words: always the human good speaking, and always underneath, something hateful, something detestable and murderous. Wise speech and good intentions—they were invariably maggoty with these secret inclinations to destroy the man in the man. Whenever he heard anyone holding forth: the landlady, this doctor, the spokesman on the pit bank: or when he read the all-righteous newspaper; his soul curdled with revulsion as from something foul. Even the infernal love and good-will of his wife. To hell with good-will! It was more hateful than ill-will. Self-righteous bullying, like poison gas!

The landlady looked at the clock.

“Ten minutes to, gentlemen,” she said coldly. For she too knew that Aaron was spoiled for her for that night.

The men began to take their leave, shakily. The little doctor seemed to evaporate. The landlady helped Aaron on with his coat. She saw the curious whiteness round his nostrils and his eyes, the fixed hellish look on his face.

“You'll eat a mince-pie in the kitchen with us, for luck?” she said to him, detaining him till last.

But he turned laughing to her.

“Nay,” he said, “I must be getting home.”

He turned and went straight out of the house. Watching him, the landlady's face became yellow with passion and rage.

“That little poisonous Indian viper,” she said aloud, attributing Aaron's mood to the doctor. Her husband was noisily bolting the door.

Outside it was dark and frosty. A gang of men lingered in the road near the closed door. Aaron found himself among them, his heart bitterer than steel.

The men were dispersing. He should take the road home. But the devil was in it, if he could take a stride in the homeward direction. There seemed a wall in front of him. He veered. But neither could he take a stride in the opposite direction. So he was destined to veer round, like some sort of weather-cock, there in the middle of the dark road outside the “Royal Oak.”

But as he turned, he caught sight of a third exit. Almost opposite was the mouth of Shottle Lane, which led off under trees, at right angles to the highroad, up to New Brunswick Colliery. He veered towards the off-chance of this opening, in a delirium of icy fury, and plunged away into the dark lane, walking slowly, on firm legs.",0.3956189379678108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just need a pick-me-up only for tonight
Don’t tell anyone I was with ya
Yeah, it’s good stuff, but I’m resistin' now
Take it if you want
Think I've fallen out of my feelings

We don’t wanna go home (Better dance for us)
You’re fucked but, oh, you’re so fun (How you holding on?)
I don’t know tomorrow (If it comes or not)

You won't save the night for me
You won't save the night for me

I thought I might get some sleep
I stretched myself out onna antique bed
An' my spirit did a midnight creep
You know I'll never sleep no more

It seem to me that it just ain't wise
Didja ever wake up in the mornin'
With a zomby woof behind your eyes
Just about as evil as you could be

I am the zomby woof
I'm that creature all the ladies been talkin' about
I am the zomby woof

Reety-awrighty, he da zomby woof

An' I was a Zomby for you, little lady

I got a great big pointed fang
Which is my zomby toof
My right foot's bigger than my other one is
Like a reg'lar zomby hoof
If I raid your dormitorium
Don't try to remain aloof
I might snatch you up screamin' through the window all nekkid
An' do it to you up on the roof
Don't mess with the zomby woof

We were just riding high
Those glory days
With all of our dreams alive
It was sweet to taste

Now that we're all alone
And caught off track
We gotta find the light
And not look back

Shadows save meeeeee

Shadows save meeeeee

Shadows save meeeeee

Shadows save meeeeee (I'm coming home...home...home)

We got a second chance
Cause love won't fade
If we hold it all inside
It will still escape
Pulling us through the pain
When skies turn black
Keeping our spirits strong
So we don't look back

Foggy Mirrors,pop,Slim Dusty,332.0,"Daylight breaks, I check both mirrors, rub my eyes and light a smoke
Then a few miles further on I find a place
Where the blokes all take on breakfast, tighten wheels and check their loads
Before we start the last leg of this race
Yes this race to beat the traffic and this race to beat the scales
And this race to get unloaded early too
Seems our industry's gone crazy time is all some care about
What I'd give for those old truckin' days we knew
And as my boggies hug the white lines while the miles are flyin' by
Both my mirrors show me pictures of the past
An' in between the split shift changes to myself I swear about
That this trip with wool from Winton is my last
Goin' home, headin' home
In both mirrors clearly dear one I can see your honest face
And our children's cheery eyed at your side
Through the fog streaked mirrors clearly do I see your sunny smile
That's my love known since you were first my bride
Though my eyes are laced with roadmaps and so many years have gone
Every detail of your features I can see
And these mirrors bring me mem'ries of the laughter of our kids
As you drove them to some depot to meet me
And as my boggies hug the white lines while the miles are flyin' by
Both my mirrors show me pictures of the past
An' in between the split shift changes to myself I swear about
That this trip with wool from Winton is my last
Goin' home, headin' home
And I've asked myself a thousand times when I've been on the track
Just why you've stuck to me through all these years
As I watched my mirrors blurred by fog I cannot clearly see
My tyres is it fog or is it tears?
And as my boggies hug the white line while the miles are flying by
These old mirrors told the story of the past
And in between the split shift changes to myself I've made this vow
That this trip with wool from Winton is my last
Goin' home, headin' home at last",0.8008461813442409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cabala,pop,Davide Petrella,172.0,"[Testo di ""Cabala""]

[Strofa 1]
Proverei a spiegarti che da te non voglio niente
Forse sarà l'estate più calda di sempre
Mi ricordi quello che non ho
Non ti sento, spacco un altro iPhone
Sogno una vacanza nell'oceano
Certe cose non cambiano mai come il reggaeton
La strada cammina
Mentre tu guardi il cielo s'è fatta mattina
Ci raccontiamo che uno dei due non capiva
E tu
Ci credi alla cabala?
A un destino che ci trova sempre
A un destino che ci trova sempre
Siamo senza casa come gli Indios
Senza pace come un limbo
Senza tempo come Mingus
Tanto non ci riesci a decifrare i segni

Ci credi alla cabala?
Ci credi alla cabala?

[Strofa 2]
Proverei a spiegarti che di te io non so niente
Che si vede il mare anche con le luci spente
Questo mondo è strano mette i brividi
Danziamo al buio con gli spiriti
Siamo dei bambini con una pistola
Siamo fatti male, siamo simili
Io e te si vive alla giornata
Sigarette e aranciata
In questo viaggio ascolterei soltanto
Musica che andrà dimenticata
E allora tu
Ci credi alla cabala?
A un destino che ci lega sempre
A un destino che ci lega sempre
Qui va tutto bene ma non sei Neruda
Poesia d'amore ad una sconosciuta
Non la puoi vedere questa vita nuda
Arrivi fino in fondo e la fine è incompiuta

At least as far as soul and mind go, golden mine flow

Round frame shades for these tiny eyes
Brown face, you know I’m a clown a case
I do anything to make you laugh if you down babe

Grita siente el metal al penetrar
Jefe es el nuevo guerrero por domar
Acción siente el sudor y la tension
Puede que no estes preparado para la confrontación
Cuanto no queda aliento no valdra suplicar
No,asume las consecuencias verás que voz
Es el cabrón que controla el comité del campeon
Mi quinta quitará cuentas,criticas se hundiran en blocks

Asi,¿que tienes problemas con los Mc's?
Pues,atento al dato Bobby has destruir
Ve a repetir,solo si os gusta asi
Si Jefe no se puede dormir se pondrá a escribir
Rap con templenza
Y metáforas,no adivinanzas
Si nunca descansas pocos te podrán alcanzar
Un Mc ha de tener vivencias antes de escribir
Y no solo pensar en pulir,forzar el fin
Emplease al máximo,el buscar el lado practico
Aqui no escatimo en medios,ni en animo ni en ambicion
No soy el Bill Gates del rap
Solo abro gays en tracks
No imagineis,actuar
Fuera prejuicios ahhh
Imprevisible como saber donde caerá un rayo
Takeshi Kitano haciendo de malo
¿fallos en este track?,buscalo
Te aburriras,asumelo
Asi son los simbolos,sufre la sanción
No busque respuesta en libros,todo esta en la calle
No cuesta ser un buen Mc,se aprecia en los detalles
Tu estilo es caótico y este diagnostico
Del Doctor Lo es el lógico
Si quiere ganar sigue el código
Mi vida pasa en Wall Screen y suena en Dolby Surround
En conciertos sali doblao,lo he lamentao
Se avecina un duelo de dimensiones epicas
Depure tecnica,Mc's vas a acabar por mendigar y suplicar,¡clemencia!
Versus,violencia
Jefe de la M se reinventa con frecuencia
Un veterano no es un cura para dar perdon
Y si encima no saben rapear que se quede con Dios
¡Hijos de puta!,en La Colonia se forjó esta katana,levantela
Jefe San,me chuleo en el rap
Recuerdas que puedo hacerlo nasty si esperabas un rap de pastel
Estarás listo,apartaté,recuerda que ....

Este es uuuuoooohhhhh,.
No hay nada peor que creerse bueno cuando no se es
No quieras gustarle a todo el mundo
No hay Mc que flipe al cien por cien,de oyente
Deja de hacerte el mártir,muevete
Me jode la acidez de Mc también tienen estrés y lloran
Y bucan a otro para colaborar
Y luego montan grupos que saben que nuncan llegaran
Pero es el ciclo
Asi lo vivimos,quemamos micro
El techo no tocarás chico,tranquilo te explico
Grabé temas borracho,con resaca o en ayunas
A veces las fortunas falla y surgen las dudas
Pero mi evolucion como Mc es espectacular
Escapismo proximamente llega a tu ciudad

Quieres crear escuela con tecnicas pobre,¿no?
El Mc enfermo debe plantearselo,primero aprended
Criticas a Mc's porque no son de la calle
Cuando algunos de ellos te fulmaniaran con solo un par de frases
Tu vida rap debe ser aburrida,triste
Por eso embistes con argumentos estupidos
Critica los sinte,critica sampler
Critica a maestros grandes,no hay ley,admitelo ese es tu caracter
Dejó patente mi habilidad en el micro
Cabalgo el ritmo y sigo pensando lo mismo que ayer,primo
Demostrar incoherencia no es evolucion
Se os ve las plumas gallos,por eso Jefe pasa de vos
Mi voz es firme
Intuyo si quieren herirme
Encajo palabras de mil y uno modo,Jefe insiste
Enemigos abundan en la jungla del rap
Por suerte me sobran aliados,donde y cuando quiera,ahhh
Málaga tiene grandes Mc's,virtudes
Grandes beats,no dudes
Grandes soldados,no cruzes
Los limites,dejad la timidez
Hay que hacerlo bien,en un combate constante pillar la madurez
Jefe es el inmortal,en Showtime fabricamos tracks
Atómicos,alcoholico,Bobby Lo,mas rap
Yo,""Málaga es Caliente""
Llamame castigador,proctector de mi gente
Olvidate si miente y se paciente
Emprende la busqueda eterna,y siente las dos haches intensamente
Destreza
Con esta pieza
Para,piensa
Somo los malos del rap,¿tu quieres luchar?,empieza

Just threefold we have met before

Cold World,rap,Skrub,53.0,"[Verse 1]
(yeah yeah yo)
He's  sick of these nightmares that he's facing when he's chasing dreams
Talking  'bout the sunny days but it ain't the way it seems
He hates the way he's been lost from all the drugs he's smoked
Hoping things will turn around but not without another toke
He's  gone and pushed away, the people he loves the most
Cause  everyone can see that he's surrounded by these ugly ghosts
Now he's just alone‚ hope is all he really have
Till  that hope is turned to thinking 'bout the drugs his dealer has
But he's got no cash‚ contemplates to hold em up
Fingers turning brown from all these cigarettes he's rolling up
Stressed out wondering if he has control or not
While  every drug is taking every single bit of soul he's got
He can't stomach food‚ even if he seems hungry
Can't remember the last time he tried to eat something
Staying awake days on end as if sleeps nothing
Grabbing on his chest every time his heartbeat rushes

[Chorus]
It's not, just these demons all this world upon our shoulders
It's these demons that just make the world look colder
Everything we touch, turn to dust like the bridges burn to smolders
So we're stuck inside a hell that's getting colder (getting colder)
It's not‚ just these demons all this world upon our shoulders
It's these demons that just make the world look colder
Everything we touch, turn to dust like the bridges burn to smolders
So we're stuck inside a hell that's getting colder (getting colder)
[Verse 2]
Another, day comes he sick of starting at the same face
And looking at reflections of his past mistakes made
He can't wrap his head around the one that changed fate
To lose a girl he met and fell in love with since eighth grade
He thought he protected her‚ yo but he was wrong
He never had the sense of fun he'd always keep her from
She started getting dragged down to where he belong
The drugs and anger was just past the point where she could stop
She kept her distance hoped he get his head intact
He calls her every single day, with no message back
He can't get the fact of why she hasn't sent a text
He doesn't know she's at these parties tryna find some better sex
Cause she was unloved, so cheating was a second guess
Walking 'round these parties looking for who's best in dress
He gets an SMS, but it's not from her
His stomach turns tryna breathe as he's lost for words

[Chorus]
Its not, just these demons all this world up on our shoulders
Its these demons that just make the world look colder
Everything we touch turn to dust like the bridges burn to smolders
So we're stuck inside a hell that's getting colder (getting colder)
Its not, just these demons all this world up on our shoulders
Its these demons that just make the world look colder
Everything we touch turn to dust like the bridges burn to smolders
So we're stuck inside a hell that's getting colder (getting colder)
[Verse 3]
All these, paranoid thoughts always messing with his head
Now he's flipped the switch because his mates are getting with his ex
He had suspicions now he's seen it with his own eyes
Photos of em getting with his homie's since like 09'
He quickly reminisced the days when it was just them
Crushed him to see her love his homie like she loved him
He got up quick he was in his room and raged with hate
Hitting every wall he can while searching for a razor blade
He's saying to himself he needs to take this pain away
Thinks it's too late to change now everything just ain't the same
But he changes pace, tries to think a bit
There's gotta be a better option than just slitting wrist
He drops the razor blade and rushes to the kitchen sink
Starts to grab the biggest knife that he can find to fit his grip
And he's too fucked up to think in all the midst of this
He puts it to his neck saying he's never really fit to live

[Chorus]
It's not, just these demons all this world upon our shoulders
It's these demons that just make the world look colder
Everything we touch, turn to dust like the bridges burn to smolders
So we're stuck inside a hell that's getting colder (getting colder)
It's not, just these demons all this world upon our shoulders
It's these demons that just make the world look colder
Everything we touch, turn to dust like the bridges burn to smolders
So we're stuck inside a hell that's getting colder (getting colder)",0.2540004194015637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Home,pop,The Promise is Hope,27.0,"I find myself at 33 years old with an aching in my soul
Like longing for the warmth of a mid-summer’s night
While the world’s covered in snow
Or like the memory of a place I’ve never been
A place I once called home
Though I’ve tried to hide it
It’s worn me down to fight the question burning in my bones

I have been longing, longing to know - can I feel settled down in my soul
Can I be deeply secure, can I know it for sure that I am well
That all will be well

I am grateful for my family, friends, and my wife, for the work I was made to do
But those birds rise on the wind, and I wish just like them
To feel at ease in my own skin
This is deep calling out to deep, it is a thirst I cannot quench
I have felt it for some time, my well is running dry
And I am thirsting for some peace

I have been longing, longing to know - can I feel settled down in my soul
Can I be deeply secure, can I know it for sure that I am well
That all will be well

At the end of the day I just want to be

Átjár A Fájdalom,rap,Flke,1689.0,"Slink:

Átjár a fájdalom , ott van a válladon
A sok gond amikor, minden utolér
Ez csak egy állapot a napokat számolom
Mikor fog újra rám sütni a fény

Trick:

Álltam a fagyban, mindig egyedül maradtam
Lenéznek az emberek, csak rappelni akartam
Mindent beletettem, mindenem feltettem
Néha apámra emlékeztettek, neki se kellettem!
Rég nem érdekel, hogy nem ismer el a szakma
Nem vagyok én csibész, csak a palócoknak fattya
Egy álmodozó kölyök vagyok, én még tesó mindig
Talán elrepít az utam majd egyenesen a célig

Sala:

Rosszat akartok látom végre, hogy nincsen bennetek semmilyen jó
Hogy megbocsásson nektek az Úr ott fenn, elment végre az a hajó
Elment minden szerelem, barát, nem kell többé semmi ilyen
Marad a család az RTM szektor nem látjátok, hogy ki milyen
Jól mondta Busta, ha megérted egyszer nem hallgatod csak a brigádomat
Ide nem kell semmilyen pénz, meg külsőség, hogy megértsd a világomat
Ezer új flowval jöttünk ki, ezer új zene még bennem van

Belém martál sokszor, pedig a szívem neked adtam
De én voltam egy hülye, hogy ellopjad hát hagytam
Belátom most már, hogy érted sem lesz kár
És ha paraszt voltam veled, hidd el az nekem jobban fájt
Mint a gondok, ez is majd elszáll
Körbe vesz az érzés, folyton körülöttem jár!
De én nem adom fel soha
Bízni kell testvér, mert minden nap egy csoda!

Sala

Vártam az az esőben láttam, hogy jössz
Csak nem hozzám, kössz!
Pillanat alatt lett szeretetből
Gyűlölet most már az emberek közt
Volt sok könny, meg sírás nevetés
Most meg csak mindent feledés
Tettek mentek a süllyesztőbe
Minden kérdésem utánterelés
Vártam az esőben láttam, hogy mész
De már nem együtt mentünk
Barátság, szeretet, szerelem örökké
El nem múlót így végezzük
Nem fékezzük az indulatokat
Azt hisszük, hogy ahogy van jó az!

Nincs már mitől féljek, kamu spanságból nem kérek

Átjár a fájdalom, remeg az én testem

Elköszönök viszlát, itt véget ért az utam

Josie Escalido,country,Casey Donahew,2994.0,"[Verse 1]
Josie Escalido, she lived south of the border
In a church her granddaddy's daddy built
A little Catholic mission where she spent her days wishin'
That he would come along and she'd be saved
Jimmy was an outlaw, an outcast from the badlands
He rode a horse as black as his heart
Stayed hopped up on mezcal, chased whiskey with saloon gals
But he never could get Josie off his mind

[Chorus]
He said, ""Meet me after midnight, I'll be ridin' hot and fast
And our love is like a slow dance, I'm just tryna make it last
And I'm layin' down my six guns, and surrenderin' my heart
It'll be rosary and sangria, Tequila, and the cross, outlaws, angels, and the lost""

[Verse 2]
Jimmy married Josie in that little mountain chapel
He made a vow to Josie and the God
He'd turn from his wicked ways and leave behind his outlaw days
And pray for forgiveness from his sins
But the past is like a storm that crashes in from the north
Rode south with the posse set on death
Blood all over Jimmy's hands and Josie lyin' in the desert sand
With a bullet that tore Jimmy's heart in two
[Chorus]
And he screamed, ""Meet me after midnight, I'll be ridin' hot and fast
And our love is like a slow dance, I'm just tryna make it last
And I'm layin' down my six guns, and surrenderin' my heart
It'll be rosary and sangria, Tequila, and the cross, outlaws, angels, and the lost""

[Verse 3]
When you're searching for the devil, turns out he's not hard to find
He rides a horse as black as his heart
Hell and fire with two six-guns, a black horse on a dead-end run
When he rode into the rangers camp at dawn
Jimmy buried Josie in the ashes of that chapel, left the rangers lyin' in the sun
Rode out toward the badlands and maybe God will understand that sometimes even angels will get lost

[Chorus]
And he cried, ""Meet me after midnight, I'll be ridin' hot and fast
And our love is like a slow dance, I'm just tryna make it last
And I'm layin' down my six guns, and surrenderin' my heart

Детка зовет «папа», и в сердце навсегда северный Ватикан
Время — мой bubble gum, подарок вселенной
Трахать игру — вдохновенно, не кончать, даже когда антракт
Отжившие свое, не любят прощаться
Но игра сегодня — это мрачные будни реанимаций, факт
В Клубе 27 не устроил танцы
Хотя, знаешь, были все шансы
Никто не знает, что мы выкинем завтра
Хотя, знаешь, для эффекта нужно вламываться внезапно
Классический, как итальянские бренды
Переступишь черту, и со своим дерьмом запрыгнешь в блендер
Хищное строение умов на генетическом уровне
У меня к этим позерам нелюбовь
Это скорее всего взаимно, но, знаешь, меня вдохновляет их нелюбовь

Никто из нас не святой, но то, что шепчешь мне на ухо, скверно
Шел на жертвы, иду на жертвы
Не удивляйся, что я все еще здесь, это закономерно

Мы подозрительно счастливы для большинства
Я возьму тебя за руку и выведу в ночь, туда, где праздник

Lead Safe certification Philadelphia: https://www.google.com/maps?cid=9058064733978719140

The Lead-Based Paint Renovation, Repair and Painting Program is a federal regulatory program that affects contractors, painters, plumbers, carpenters, electricians and even residential rental property owners and managers. The program begins April 22, 2010.

In general, any activity that disturbs paint in a home, apartment, or child-occupied facility built before 1978 including remodeling, repairs and maintenance, electrical work, plumbing, painting, carpentry and window replacement is subject to the program. If lead paint is present, lead safe work practices would require the remodeler to minimize dust, prepare and clean the work area, and contain lead dust. Since lead paint was banned in the US in 1977, this program applies to homes built before 1978.

Only contractors that have registered with the EPA are allowed to perform this type of work. And only Certified Renovators and specially trained crews can carry out lead safe work practices. To become registered, a remodeling firm should submit the renovator firm application form with the appropriate filing fee. To become a Certified Renovator, remodelers and contractors should sign up for and successfully complete an EPA-approved course.

In addition, the remodeler is required to provide the customer with a pamphlet entitled ""Renovate Right"" before any work begins. A signed acknowledgement from the customer to prove that the pamphlet was received is required and the acknowledgement must be kept in the contractor's files for a period of time as defined by the EPA.

If lead-based paint is found at the work-site, other forms are required in order to document that proper work practices were followed. These forms must be kept in the contractor's job files in case of audit by the EPA.

There are several exemptions and exclusions that can apply so that lead safe work practices may not be required even on a house built before 1978. These include (1) the property was built after 1977; (2) a small amount of painted space is being disturbed; and (3) the homeowner chooses to exempt the property if no children or pregnant women live in or regularly visit the property. All of the exemptions and exclusions require documentation.

Some contractors may be tempted to perform renovation work in pre-1978 homes without the necessary training and registrations. Don't do it! The EPA can assess fines of up to $37,500 per day per violation.

Young nigga had hoop dreams
Things ain’t work out in my favor, so I switched dreams
I never thought that I’d be rapping, it's surprising
I told y’all that I’d get this shit by any means
And then I fucked up the game when I learned to sing
I didn’t make it to the league, but I got a team
They said my family had a star, but they ain’t believe it was me
So like Demarcus Cousins, yeah, I'ma ball with kings
'Cause I’m a king

I ain’t make it to the NBA, but I can show a nigga how to ball
Sometimes I be tripping, I just pray I never ever fall
I stay in my lane like Ken Nugent, it only takes one call
That’s why when they hate my eyes stay on Ray Charles
'Cause I’m a better man
Life did me so dirty, I thought my name was Dan
But I always stayed ten toes, nah, I never ran
That’s how I learned to ball without no helping hand
I shot my shot at life, I made an all netter
When I was at the bottom, I just knew it get better
I was taking L’s back to back, now I don’t know that letter
And we ain’t never been rats, but we chasing all this cheddar

They always said, ""to play the game, you gotta be made for it""
We was just down bad, now we done upped the score
Young nigga coming from the south, but I’m going north
I’m finally getting everything that I prayed for
I’m dropping hits back to back, like I’m in OT
I be wondering, ""why they still doubt me?""
I guess the dry air makes them hate from the nosebleeds
I swear it’s funny 'cause they don’t even know me
So I told my team that we gone ball forever
We chasing green like the Celtics, we a three leaf clover
Yeah, we gone make it rain, it don’t matter the weather
But I thank God that my situation got better
It feels like yesterday I was struggling with rent
Now when I hit the mall, I can’t remember what I spent
I threw myself an ally, nobody gave me an assist
I’m glad I’m finally balling 'cause life was different on the bench

Stayin out way too late. Feels like we've seen it all
From Corpus up to Amarillo everybody's heard the news
Watch out San Antonio can give you the north side blues

All the nights and miles and memories they feel like one big dream
And you just don't know what to expect when things ain't what they seem
Just when you think that you're ahead and you finally paid your dues
Then you wake up the next morning with a case of the north side blues

San Antone! San Antone!
Why don't you leave me alone
You know I've always loved ya
You make me feel at home
But you took all those things from me now
Some things I hate to lose
Every time I go back to you now
You give me the north side blues

Well we grooved on to El Paso way and across to Austin too
And travelin down the river walk is a real fun thing to do
But be careful not to lose yourself and listen to my clues
Or you'll wind up just like me. Singin thE north side blues

Na, wie geht's in euerem Kästchen

Geh gern über dünnes Eis

Flieg auf nem Drachen
Von Pol zu Pol

Ich will tauchen bis zum Tiefenrausch
Eine Nacht in der Wüste
Ein Wochenende im Irrenhaus
Ich will verbrennen, explodieren
Nichts in der Hand und nichts mehr im Griff
Alle Bremsen sollen blockieren
Volle Kraft aufs nächste Riff
Ich will mich töten
Will mich retten
Will barfuß durch die Hölle gehen

Will die Welt nicht durch die Glotze sehen

Swim in the bed, but them thoughts might drown you
Don't hit the ground, yet prepared to fly away
They took your crown but don't let em take your pride to
Living a lie they suggested don't account for
All of the things that you wanted are around more
Than you expected in a dream, it's now or
Never, ever, close your eyes off the things you love
Don't be a victim of you
Everything come in time, be patient
You at the bar getting live complacent
I get it popping, I ain't judging, just saying
Don't got to lean on your problems, just face them
Or you could pop a pill and erase them
Add a vodka, Sprite, and then chase them
Sniff a line coke with them base heads
Smoke a pound of weed and just lace it
You crazy, already lost my mind, I'm just pacing
Back and forth in time while we got some
They say the end is near so let's count them

The same game other girl, I guess a different name
The clock ticking, so the plot thickens

Always want to be on top, make the love stop
Picture perfect painting, photoshopped
With your heart cropped out
With old in, with the new start
The way the fountain of youth flows to the last drop
Oh, that's not your type living
Relationship grow old if we don't make decisions
I mean that's a boat load, if we consider swimming
Swim good to the ocean or the valley of the sun I guess
Instead, you flail around with water wings
Fall like what autumn brings
Drowning in the love that used to flow beneath the vitamins

Mit deinem Kopf wirst du zum Kunstwerk
Ich bin gefährlich und deshalb nützlich wie ein Atomkraftwerk
Nicht, dass wir uns jetzt falsch verstehen
Atomenergie birgt Risiken in sich, die im Vergleich zum Nutzen überverhältnismäßig groß sind
Ich bin 1 Meter 83 auch wenn du 2 Meter 2 bist musst du zu mir aufsehen
Das ist kein Größenwahn, dass sind meine Flows die so groß sind
Dein Tod wird kein Aufsehen erregen
Denn Regentropfen stopfen dir das Maul
Ja, du hast richtig gehört
Du wirst von Wassertropfen zerstört

Du battlest gegen uns und kommst zu Tode
Bevor du gegen Real Geizt battlest hast du dich zu Tode erschrocken

Spasten wie dir fällt es zu Lasten

Ich darf Toys busten
Lecks ertasten und schließlich
Ohne Vorwarnung auf Toys scharf schießen
Einige Opfer ließen sich nicht vermeiden

Ich kämpfe für Gerechtigkeit und zwar um jeden Preis
Blut, Schweiß, keine Tränen

Mein electronic Style lässt Toys erblinden
B-Boys erfinden Moves
Produzenten erfinden Loops
MCs erfinden Flows

A z nich spływający wosk powoli, bezszelestnie
Zatrzymany nagle jak uczucie nasze wierne
Lekki uśmiech na ustach, zgubione gdzieś spojrzenie
By czuć zapach twego ciała, skryte me marzenie
Rosnące z każdym dniem, kwitnące jak płatki róży
Dosięga serca mego nocą w czasie burzy
Bez ciebie mijające minuty, godziny, dni
Wpatrzony w od łez mokre zdjęcie a na nim ty
Stojąca jak bogini wyrwana z moich marzeń
Niezapomnianych wiele i nie zapomnę chwili tej
To już przeszłość, choć na zawsze w mojej głowie
Wzrok pełen ciepła spoglądający spod powiek
Teraz siedzę sam wspominając tamte chwile
W pokoju, w czterech ścianach pragnąc przeżyć czasu milę
Bez ciebie nie, tylko z tobą za tym tęskne
Nie mnie przy Tobie, lecz przy mnie nie ma ciebie

Gdy obok pięknych dni były także złe
I po raz pierwszy u ciebie ujrzałem łzę
Spływającą po policzku jak kropla deszczu na szybie
Dziś nie wybaczę sobie, że tak zraniłem ciebie
Niewinną niczemu dziewczynę, wciąż nie wierzę w to
Że przez chwilę mogłem złamać nasze życie
Zrozumiałem wtedy, że jesteś dla mnie wszystkim
Nie mogę ciebie stracić, bo bez ciebie byłbym niczyj
Teraz już wiem, że nie powtórzę tego kroku
Chcę abyś była przy mnie na zawsze przy mym boku
Chciałbym to naprawić tylko powiedz jak?
Nie martw się już o nic, stworzymy jeden świat
Kochać nie przestanę chcę odzyskać zaufanie
W trudnych chwilach być przy tobie
Bo już nigdy cię nie zranię
Dla nas nic nie znaczą przeciwności losu
Moja miłość ponad życie, muszę wyrwać ją z chaosu

I'm like a hurricane, nothing can stop me
And when I put my mind into it, I'm just like Rocky
Remember those words, I won't forget about my dreams
It's all about me now, it's all about me
See, I don't really give a fuck what you've been doin'
I've been doin' this for years, no fears, that's how we do it up here
Never doubted myself, my shit is hotter than hell (yeah)

Suddenly they say they be there till the end (fake ass)
I can forgive but not forget, be thankful for that (hah)

But they keep on talking shit and everybody's hatin' me
So I'ma keep on making songs and they keep on hatin' me
And I ain't gonna stop, until I finally get some better days (aha)
Finally see some brighter days, where I don't wanna fly away

This is how I feel, I'm so disconnected
How do you deal, not knowing what's coming next (shit)
I've tried everything the way intervention works (no)
Cause inside my head it hurts, I am dying in this verse
But fuck if I don't finish, I'm a glutton for punishment (hahaha)
Even when enough is enough, I'm still stuck in it

A Long Time Ago,pop,David Ford,65.0,"Clouds on the moon
It was a hollywood sky
I sat on the wall, 'til your parents drove by
And i walked to you door
And remember how you smiled
Well that was a long time ago

Your fault or mine
It's such a tough one to call
Do you one day look up to see your innocence fall
From a twelve storey window, to the concrete below
It was all such a long time ago

Now your path and mine
They never seem to converge
And now sat here in god-knows-where with a mouthful of words
Well they just sound like noises
If you say them enough
It was all such a long time ago

Now was it though?
In some underground saloon
Where you can always get a drink
There's a girl by the cigarette machine
And i think i'll strike up a conversation
But i wouldn't know how
Doesn't seem such a good idea now...

With the clouds on the moon
Another hollywood sky
It's time i dragged myself home and to wonder just why
I still think of you know
Only as you were then

It was all such a long time ago

Now was it though?",0.49106406210921705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Untitled,rap,Black Star,410.0,"[Verse 1: Mos Def]
What it is, what your name, what you want
Fly while I'm dreamin', I'm fly in real life
Eyes open, bright, show you what it feel like
Soul glo even when light is absent
Shown up, Kweli and Mos are the craftsmiths
Say what, turn the volume up, yes that's them
Song vibrates classic
Pain so hard they you gon' be askin' for asprin
Sick to everlastin'
No way to make it happen, Jack
On the quest to manifest the unimagine, black
What they dealin' with is weak derivatives
You fiend over Benjamins, we seek deliverance
The world that we livin' in is filled with ignorance
Impotence, belligerence, stock market dividends
Smog and carcinogens, global imprisonment
This all be fire beneath cheesy listenin'
This what they play when they slip the ammunition in
Take aim, fire, empty, reload, and they spit again
A holler in a Hoover, cessside where we hittin' them
I'm ready to ride, is y'all brothers gettin' in?
Well make some noise if you with it then
Show the inner city kid there's no givin' in
No givin' up
Flatbush crew, big it up
Let your big Jamaican brother live it up
From the big cat, to the little cup
Cats screamin' ""Kill it up, spill it up""
Never be real enough
A punk with a gun
A snatch furnace
She spend work permits
Disperse the skirmish
Green a card to a German
Hot to the touch like the engine rode furnace
Makin' dollars like Parrish Smith and E. Sermon
From the money earnin' Mount Vernon
The East Germans out in Berlin
Crack the park side down to sterling
Mos Def ebonic flow most certain
Block your light like I'm closed curtains
Best of whole good and closed circuit
Brooklyn native black, no merchant
I got them hoppin' like they toes hurtin'
Soul stirrin'
From the old school to the most current
It's on point and on mission and on purpose
Boots on, fiends don't hurt it
The long verse is a strong surgeon's
Straight off the turban
Some Sahara to the suburban
It's emergin', with each version
So each person
Within earshot, get a clear shot
Of red rock
They'll not, see the tear drops
We're here, aiight
Yes yes of course (Right here)
They thought we was gone, we been here, all along
You're welcome (What?)
You're welcome, thanks (Say it again)

Serve Somebody,rap,Wolfman D,11.0,"Who wants to step to me?
I've got a secret recipe
To battle anybody in the crowd
Trying to heckle me
Step away from the mike
Lest ye be cursed with leprosy
And start cleaning toilets
In the barracks for some extra cheese
I'm an artist
Who's known to scar folks
When I get into detail
And stop speaking in broad strokes
Chops that ass
Like karate
If you keep hating on me
That's all right but I'm gonna have to serve somebody

(Hook)
Serve somebody
Walk up in my place
And I'm dressed kind of classy
Step up in my face
You get served something nasty

You don't want to battle me
Mc booty; I bust that
Don't touch that
My rhymes have rabies like lyrical muskrats
Think you're a rebel?
I leave rappers disheveled
Dazed in the basement
While I'm on the top level
They revel and sulk
I heavily pedal my hulk-
Esque ego, keeping MCs
Steadily shook
Got crooks in every little cranny and knook
I roll by, then throw in the hook
Make sure they heard how
I'm gonna have to serve somebody

Hook

You don't want beef
You're a vegetarian... Really
You'll get sliced, diced and served
In vegetarian chilly
I got carnivorous flows
You're out the chopped liver bin
I eat MCs on beats (beets) in these streets
I'm out to kill again
Confidence will disapear
So mysterious
Rhymes so weird, you won't believe your eyes
'Cause I'm the eeriest (ear-iest)
Not the type to be jaded
Because I'm hated on
But the next dude I find hating
Is getting waited on

AWAKE!
It's nice to be back
Did I ever leave?
I was strolling through the universe
Just in case you missed it
Everything's the same
I won't change if you don't care

Reaching over, Falling under

[Verse 2]
Compromises I can't comprehend yet
Buildings crumbling over this false pretension, please!
Get out of my way !

[Verse 3]
Filling the void with random stuff
Such as silly Ice kids in the park
Or KFC cheese above the spark
Tons of tonies' almonds eaten by
These bloody worms, stuck in the sky
Are cracking, are crying for you to die
Look at me! I'm already free
But ,my brain is empty, so re-peat
(wait and see! , the void is filled
It's time to wave your hand and say ''hi!'')
[Verse 4]
Hey guys hello, Bill here, one more day!
Hello Jessica, morning Randall
Hello captain tiny lil' cock known to everybody as, Michael

[Verse 5]
Well, Buddy this is not what I expected, I will never, ever be a man
Insecurity detected, point your fucking finger at me!
What are you going to say (I don't know yet)
Please shut your mouth, don't say yes (And if I say...)
I think you're going to fail, again, again
Jessica is beyond your reach (I don't think so)
Your mind is suffering a glitch (Leave me alone)
Rickitipackitipich!, OH NO!

SO VIRGIN AND ALONE!

Going home, today, falling in myself!

[Verse 6]
Hungry and tired as shit, I'm getting home
I should have called my mom to turn the oven on
Half toast and a pair of pills will be enough
Naps at my living room are way more...

[Verse 7]
Hey Bill, you forgot to leave, your reports on my desk
That means I'm not gonna pay you this month, say thanks motherfucker
Cause I could fire you today, find new work, just in case
You stay here this afternoon til the night, Billy you deserve it
I hope you arrive at office before six o'clock
If not, well, you know, you can stay everyday at home
FUCK IT!

Let's go, take a little stroll, now, in the park

[Verse 8]
DAMN! So you chose the hard way, we're supposed to be kind to eachother
Coworkers, even good pals
FUCK! You chose the cosmic way, now I'm not thinking quite well
Tell me a fucking reason to not tear your fucking body apart

I'm not here
He's not there
We are friends
Not anymore
What is that?
Strange smile
Wink at me
With an eye outside
Red fits you well
But my spiral is way cooler

[Verse 10]
Hey lad welcome to a place far beyond your mind
Quite different stars are shining on you, dont hide
Stream through the smell of poo , through corners of barf
That blonde girl's mine , watch out, man you drink it, you die
Hahaha just kidding bruh, you look terrified
Let me tell you more about, the night, the night

Young boy , we'll entertain you, the flavour of victory
Lies within, if you keep on licking licking
Trust me , follow the party, you're full of shit
Buddy, now let your own sexuality be the true guide

[Verse 12]
Man, what the heck was that
The strangest shit I've seen
He was a crazy homeless guy
With nothing good to say
Although it's obvious guys
I'll emphasize the theme
The story arc is thin and clear
And feelings are quite real

[Verse 13]
I don't know where I've being at
This place looks like LAS VEGAS
There are some things that I did
I can't remember well, now...
Two pills and I forget that
With whisky and soda, lady
I'm gonna smash this fucking
Slot machine and I will win again

[Verse 14]
Streaming the night
Streaming the dark
Streaming the night away
Streaming the dark supremacy

Hey boss you forgot to leave your head screwed to your neck
Hey girl my place is quite near , enjoy this ultimate flirteum

[Verse 16]
Lets go take a little pill, take a little pill now
Lets go take a little pill at the rave

[Verse 17]
Good night everybody, welcome to another session of musical conundrum
This new zombie party is the result of your first world problems that no one cares about, let your own sexuality be the guide
Feel free to transcend with the abuse of drugs, i dont give a fuck
Intoxicate, transcend, go ahead!

We're in this together man
All you need to do is dance
And inject your fears in vein
Rejoice in your sudden end
On your own forever and
Insecure to make amends
We won't care if you dont change

There's an impulse over this false pretension
Maybe I learn from today
Falling in myself!

And silver in my early morning
Today I will not smell red color
Sweet glowing green body tomorrow

1948, Christmas eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee shot Billy DeLions
And he blew that poor boy down
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?
Because Billy DeLions threw the lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat
Bayo, Bayo, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee is a madman and he shot my Billy D
Bayo go get him or give the job to me
Delia DeLions, dear sweet Delia-D
How the hell can I arrest him? He's twice as big as me
Well don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive [no more]
Not only is that mother big but he packs a .45 [four]
Bayo, Delia said, just give me a gun
He shot my Billy dead now I'm going to see him hung
She went into the DeLion's club through Billy DeLions blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar
Said, ""Buy me a gin fizz, love.""
As Stagger Lee lit a cigarette she shot him in the balls
Blew the smoke off her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayo, Bayo, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead and now he's got to die
Delia went a walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played ""Near My God to Thee""
But Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could it be?
The song that woman sung was ""Look Out Stagger Lee""

Kus plotu do kleští ku slávy zmaru

Tři vrazi ve tmě šli dál v cestě jim kdosi stál
Zachovali však klid, stačilo vystřelit
Na noční košilce hned vykvetl rudý květ
Ten pohled nesnesu. Padala bez hlesu

Rána tě budí, kdo to tam střílí ?
Kdepak máš dceru, snad nešla ven
Podlaha studí , siréna kvílí
Kéž teď by bylo včera ! Kéž by to byl sen !
Tak teď už konečně víš, že za štěstí zaplatíš
Neměls mít víc než ty tři chlapi prokletý
Co ukuli v hospodě plán, jak máš být vychován
Za to že líp ses měl a kdekdo ti záviděl

Pistoli v šupleti máš, dlouho jí schováváš
Pečlivě v hadříku – má to svou logiku !

252 Brighton Ave,rock,Devon Kay & The Solutions,62.0,"It all started for me in 2014
I lost my mind and left the scene for the city of the bean
I cut my tooth on Brighton Ave
Living fast and living loose until I ran out of juice

And all it’s been is a yearning for the Northeastern wind
That I never called home

Didn’t realize I fell outta love
Crammed 2 XR of the 30 ones
Adderall and alcohol in place of meals and healthy talks

But I was on top of everything
A chemically inflated brain
An ecstasy of proficiency and sunken eyes from lack of sleep

Then I saw your face in a garden space behind the place where I worked
You were tired too of the city like zoo but little did we know that we left to soon",0.3415532037615776,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Cruel Bard,pop,Heresiarh,31.0,"This is the lay of the cruel bard
He wrote it himself in his perilous youth
And nobody knows and no other lay tells
If fate finally gave him a lesson or no

He was a bard as anyone else yet nature had praised him a gift of its worth - an irresistible beauty
And charm of the lords, which he did not hesitate to use for his own good

Pleasure he seeked and the inevitable pain, which eventually scorched his soul beyond recognition
So that it was never completely healed unless for the moments when he was alone with the
Splendour of nature and his love for the sky

Long roads did he take and many a path and lots of young girls fainted away to his enthralling
Songs and caressing lips. Yet his heart could not find any place for a rest...

(Oh) The cruel bard
He was
And his lays were fair
As dew in the grass
Yet his heart was of stone...
Thousands of burnt villages he left behind
And thousands of hearts unmended
Wherever he went he brought pleasure, then woe
To daughters and mothers and envious men

He knew it all very well, the cruel bard
But, hell, he had nothing at all to disown
So he just grinned as the devil himself
And all the women around lost their pride

Although he sometimes did try to unlock his heart
Hid under strong chest of marble and snow
Yet he could not help loving anyone else
But himself and the dark of his kingly bent brows

Like a motionless sculpture of a pale heathen god
The bard used to stare in a mirror of glass
And he was ensnared in the webs of his own
Reflection of beauty so kingly yet cold...",0.5524858897551894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanna bring him to his knees

A perfect lover, more than a cover
'Cause after me there won't be no other
Do you understand? I want a man

He can take control when I can't decide
He better know when to back down and look me in the eyes
Weak enough to bend and strong enough to cry
When to take a stand and when to apologize

I wanna bring him to his knees

To dig a deep grave with a shovel

Legetøj du snitted' med din lommekniv
En flyvemaskine med Dannebrog på halen
Og magen en nat siden hen, fløj jeg med den
Henover Fochbecker Chaussee og Kielerkanalen
Og magen en nat siden hen, fløj jeg med den

Weapon Of War,rock,Airbourne,106.0,"Remember when the sweet birds sang
Remember when the bombs rained
In the year of the quite sun
When we thought the world was one
Now I'm a war, weapon of war
Don't need to know who I'm fightin' for
I'll be your war, your weapon of war
Just waitin' for the world to end

Business is boomin'
Castin' coffins for the dead
Building tanks, bombs and guns
The arms race has just begun
In the year of the nuclear sun
It's a race that can't be won
Our missiles light the sky
Now nothing will survive

Now I'm a war, weapon of war

Shoot whenever they say, death is on his way)

I'm your war, weapon of war
What the hell am I fightin' for

De flexfit
Afinando a setlist
Convoco pro sex, me levo prum carro flex!
Deixei as technics
Levei pro backseat!
De cap snap back, me lembrava a Kelly Key
Yayaya! ela mexeu com o mestre Splinter
O Rapper Stifler
Fiz até Scratch no Sfinkter
Voltei pro palco pressão baixa, perna trêmula!
Cê vai me perdoar!
Gata nós nos vemos lá
Depois do show colou com a amiga

Só por favor não filmem
Então me usem
E abusem no quarto!

Traga-me mas não traga meu bonde e meus parça
E essa maluca de pedra que vem cheirando a trapaça
Era uma cilada, Bino, rolou o som do Bino
Em vez de chiclete ela pediu logo um pino
Eu só tenho um fino e vim de rolê
Saquei que a gata tinha plástica até na sola do pé

Onde cê ta indo, Nog? Vou lá socorrer o Nog!

Que sou casado e tenho umas contas pra pagar
Mas ela não reclama, assim que nego gusta
Ela não quer me pegar, só quer beber nas minhas custas

Mar do Caribe, no olhar vermelhidão ferrari
Bem vilão no lounge, rolando atary

No bololô nós dois e um balcão de inox
Não era trol mas eu queria trocks

Wave after wave they call out and say believe
Oh what a revelation
You’ve lifted our heads and opened our eyes
And this is our declaration

[Verse 2]
We believe we believe… You are God
We believe we believe… You are good
You have conquered the grave, Taken our sin away
We believe we believe… every Word
You have breathed we believe… we are yours
And with each breath You give us, We will proclaim
We believe we believe
We believe we believe
[Verse 3]
Now as we stand before You
We want to give You more than a song
We want lives that prove, that we really do believe
You’ve given us the Revelation
Now take your church and turn us into
A living declaration

[Verse 4]
And if our faith is weak, God help our unbelief
You are faithful, God you are faithful
And if our faith is weak, God help our unbelief
You have been faithful, You will be faithful

You say come… so here we are
Lifting up our hands and our hearts
To worship You and tell You we believe",0.911888447299134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Man I love college, I never wanna leave this place
Van Wilder, I got the keys to the gate
Hold up, hold up, yeah I think it's my turn
Let me get up in your ear, like a sideburn
Like Derek Jeter I just need to be signed
And if you don't like the track than you need to rewind
I stay going hard, I'm Cal Ripken boy
Leanin' on the cup I'm sippin boy, I'm gifted boy
Making money chips ahoy!
Just keep moving up Lane Kiffin boy
Yeah, and it's a quick decision
Fresh all my work is in mint condition
Peep the precision, surgeon on the track
Fuck goin' in, I'm bout to make a quick incision
And I go about my flow quite swiftly
Go fast, then I change it up like Cliff Lee

And I'm telling all the girls the same thing
I'm telling all the girls I love them

Now I love all the girls, but it's still cash first
Cause I just wanna ball out like a bad serve
It's pretty much a fact that your girl wanna meet me
I'm all over the web like Brett Favre's peepee
And I'm so hot right now it might melt her
And she catch my balls better than Wes Welker
Haha, God dammit I'm a douche
Been around the world and I ain't shooting hoops
It's been two months and I might get famous, cocky
Talk more shit than Skip Bayless, sorry
And you really ain't living how I'm livin'
Get so much brain that my fitted ain't fittin'
Nah, I'm just kidding, I swear I'm deserving
Comin' for the top spot quicker than a virgin
And it's over, checker the flag

Gotta get it by any means thats what i was told
Learned that from my bros
Learned you can't trust no n*gga or none of these hoes
Learned if you cook it right the fiends a come for mo'
Gotta stay on my toes
Gotta appreciate my highs as well as my lows
Facing the fact a hater can be right under my nose
Soon as i turn my back BLOAW he wanna unload
Put me in the darkest places I'm still gone glow
Eventually the truth always gets exposed
A n*gga energy will tell you what you need to know
Actions speak louder than words that's a true quote
Share a slice with ya folk when you getting a loaf
Those same people will get the toast if someone do the most
A picture worth a thousand words, watch what you post
Watch how you pose, cops wanna choke
Harass when they approach
The path you choose now is not the one you chose
Give me my roses while i am here

N*ggas wanna do it lets do it give me a day

Thought ya'll was in the game what happen why yall forfeit?

Stash like Giannis from three I'm talkin' all bricks

Gotta watch ya back the snacks a put a stake in it

Throw a coin in a wishing well, let it fall down
Send a gold balloon up into the clouds

Cow Corner,rap,NKS (NZ),19.0,"[Chorus]
One plus one equals window
When I enter a scene I don’t need no intro
Macklemore when I head to the thrift store
Laid back days, no doubt bro I miss those
Now I’m focused on the foreground for the moment
Staying close-knit with the hometown
Been through the rain, that’s why my jumper’s wet, soaking
I’ll keep grinding even if it goes unnoticed
Preparing myself to take on the ocean
But if the stage is set, then I’ll own it
My name’s stuck on your tongue like a Post-It notе
One plus one equals window
Thе game ain’t gone if you’ve lost the tip off
I go so hard on the chorus that my verse is essentially a pit stop


[Verse]
People respect me (it’s a bit odd)
My flow be colder than ice cream (Tip Top)
Schools locking down when they hear my shots (Diss God)
But I’m a real guy, not a fake rip-off
False persona, it don’t fit on
My mind is struggling to word it
‘Till this day, I’m still wondering if my work ethic is worth it
But all that I got yeah I earnt it, deserved it
I ain’t thinking ‘bout reversing no more
And I’ve turned loco, they way I’m desiring for the whole boatload
I’m wanna make sure I’m doing things now and I don’t postpone
Time is a wealth, it’s craap when that C is outdated
Can’t lie, I’m still working on being patient
I’m crossing borders
I’m a judge, the way I’m calling for order
I don’t beat around the bush
The only time I’m on the backfoot’s when I’m cutting to the point
Acting big on tracks to motivate
Reiterate ‘cause it’s like adding another coat of paint to the wall
I know I’m quiet natured, my talk ain’t cheap, that’s why you don’t get a lot
Why go for the ground shot? Imma loft for cow corner
Exploring like I’m Dora, flora, fauna
Opening doors I've never seen before
I’m checking new genres, testing the waters
If I like it, I’ll drop anchor as if I spilt some milk
I don’t need cash to be rich
I’m already rich with common sense
More than getting, I love giving compliments
I value character more than an ornament

One plus one equals window
When I enter a scene I don’t need no intro

Laid back days, no doubt bro I miss those

Op het dak van de wereld,pop,Dana Winner,530.0,"Ik heb vandaag zo'n wonderlijk gevoel
Slechts verliefden weten echt wat ik bedoel
Helder blauw is de lucht en ik straal van geluk
Want mijn leven heeft nu eindelijk een doel

Al m'n lege dagen zijn voorbij
En de zon schijnt dag en nacht alleen voor mij
Tot in 't diepst van mijn hart, dat op jou heeft gewacht
En nu dat je hier bent, voel ik me zo blij

Refrain:
'k Zit op het dak van de wereld en ik kijk naar beneden
Waar er niets of niemand mij nog raken kan
'k Zit nooit meer aan de grond, sinds de dag dat ik je vond
Zit ik heerlijk op het dak van de wereld

Alles wat ik droomde is gebeurd
En 't is net of alles zich daarom verheugd
Elke bloem, ieder blad lijkt zo glanzend en glad
En de toekomst heeft ee nieuwe roze kleur
Er is nog een ding dat ik vraag
Dat je morgen van me houdt zoals vandaag
Als je voor eeuweig lang dicht bij mij blijven kan
Is er echt niets anders meer dat ik verlang

La poignée de punchlines 48,rap,Give Me Five Prod,316.0,"[Couplet unique]
Han, plus d'dix piges qu'le rap s'est inséré sous mes draps, qu'il ma gué-dra
J'ai dit à la musique: ""T'es mon héroïne"", elle m'a dit : ""Montre moi tes bras""
Ce que je vis est réel, ma haine est viscérale
Parce que ma vie c'est elle, j'y pense en bouffant mes céréales
Je dis c'que j'veux, fais pas ta crise, j'écoute pas ce que les bâtards disent
J'ai le phrasé du sud-est, mistral et cataclysme
J'remets à demain ce que j'aurai dû faire l'an passé #procrastination
Au sol plaqué, #tournois des 6 nations
Je suis une pieuvre, mes tentacules sont mes confrères
Trop hardcore pour ta p'tite sœur, pas assez pour ton grand frère
Je paye mes quittances de loyer, j'aime la troisième mi-temps
Écoute pas s'que mon p'tit doigt m'dit, j'écoute le troisième qui s'tend
Vous voyez, mon crayon ne va pas bien mais il fait mine qu'il s'en bat les reins
Me parle pas des Femen en vrai, tu sais, je m'en bats les seins
J'ai le vertige malgré mon coté intrépide
Parce que le jour où j'arrête le rap, j'ressentirai un vrai vide
Tous c'que je fais, merde, tout ça est éphémère
J'ai mis les gazes, en effet, j'ai mis les gazes à effet d'serre
Et tu peux faire la belle, on s'en fout de s'que tu colportes
Le jour où on ferme mon label, on aura mit la clef de sol sous la porte
Dur d'assumer, jeune, alors on fume des fumigènes
On s'met zen, en s'foutant bien, que la fumée gêne
J'ai fais le plus dur, j'écrit des 16 tonitruants
J'leur fais peur comme un barbu qui porte un colis fumant
On s'plaint en vivant d'jolies drames, j'ai besoin d'un doliprane
Le rap est mon premier amour mais cet enfoiré est polygame
Travail d'orfèvre, maître de cérémonies, maître d'orchestre
Qu'est-ce que j'aime voir mes homies mettre la police hors d'elle
On t'avait dit d'rester droit, t'as l'esprit biscornu
Résiste à la tentation même devant 10 corps nus
Ridicule, on partira les pieds devant c'est dommage
Les idées qu'on véhicule s'rentre dedans, #carambolage!
Entre ceux qui veulent pas s'mouiller, les larmes qui sèchent
J'ai quelques combines, chaque jour des idées qui naissent
Tu peux fouiller, rembobine, j'ai utilisé tous les mots imposés sans antisèche!

Because you ran your mouth, what you said wasn't even true
See my man's name is Victor
His brother Mike is boning Shante, that's Eric's sister
Mike had a girl, but Shante knew
But on the down low a little rendevous
One day upstairs the two were chilling
His girl popped up, yep yep, she started illing
Mike said that's Victor's undercover lover
So victor caught on and had to cover for his brother
Walked Shante home, and said so long
But somebody saw the two and thought they had something going on
It got around like a hula hoop
And you made it your business, Victor's girl knew the scoop
Know she's beefing, flipping, and crying
Didn't believe when he said that they were lying
It's over, the relationship is done
Victor was a loyal brother if I ever knew one

Your man took a loss, but he left it at that
But you made it your business to say he was coming back
The other kid wouldn't have it
So he ran to his car, yeah he packed the automatic
And you knew he wasn't joking
So you called up your man, ""Yo yo, we gotta smoke em""
Came downstairs with the nine and the vest
Little did you know he didn't aim for the chest
Caught him in the head, now your man is dead
Rest in peace chief, cause of something that you said
Tell it to his family on his funeral day

A Matter of Perspective Part 2,rock,Colliding Parallels,9.0,"[Verse 1]
Am I the only one?
To see it all that way
It has already been gone
But you're still kneeling to pray

[Verse 2]
For those who seek the truth
Enlightenment
Its substance is transient
Nothing’s absolute

[Verse 3]
In the absence of facts
You reach to someone
You reach to something
A perception of your acts
Hiding in a red herring

[Verse 4]
A false dichotomy
The appeal is too strong
But the line is so thin
You can't ignore what's in between
Can’t you peel off this second skin?
[Chorus]
Where do you find this peace inside?
Can I let it all go, just for a while?
I must find my way
Through the vagueness of the gray
Is this really a matter of perspective?

[Verse 5]
Reason's taking its toll
Giving up the burden of proof
It's a part of me I can't control
Always finding an outlook

Am I the only one?
To see it all that way

[Verse 6]
I've salved myself from this, but why am I still sad?
I've come to my limits, I need to leave before I go mad

[Chorus]
Where do you find this peace inside?
Can I let it all go, just for a while?
I must find my way
Through the vagueness of the gray
Is this really a matter of perspective?
[Verse 7]
I've reached this day
A sense of peace to embrace
Seeing all the shades of gray

I looked to other way
Come what may

TV Overdose,rap,Henry Bowers,96.0,"[Verse 1]
I’m more than meets the eye - see I’m in disguise
The rap norm gets transformed when I begin to rhyme
At this time I’m optimized and I’m in my prime
Which makes me sort of head of the Autobots and you are sort of not
Call me a copy - you’re original - still I ain’t that impressed
I be Christian Bale while you be Adam West
Original sure but let’s get down to facts
You’re a fat guy in tights who just don’t know how to act
Is that your rap? sounds more like you snore and barf
Call me Lion-O - you are more like Snarf
I be the coolest cat in the bright neon lights
When I’m like “sword of omens give me sight beyond sight”
Disputin’ with mutants - won’t let ‘em run far
Along with Mum-Raa they blow up like Plundaar
Female kiddies want to rumble then they stumble back home
‘cause Chitara is my one and only Thundercat hoe!

A TV-OD - oh my god!
A TV-OD hit me real hard

Has any of you gentlemen and ladies heard of bowers
Who maneuvers through the sewers while displaying turtle power
Yeah no one can be as mad and mean as Henry
I’m the one who turned Bruce Banner green of envy
They ask me if we’re men or mice - we are both mice
You seem quite surprised but heed my advice
Don’t think it makes us equal - of course it’s tricky
See my first name is Danger while yours is Mickey
My force is wicked like Skywalker senior
So dismiss your wishes and witness misdemeanor
I’ve got hidden devices that’ll get your ass kicked
“daa-da-daa-da-daa Inspector Gadget”
Didn’t mean to hurt you - seems like you need a doctor
I’m all tangled up in work like my name was Peter Parker
Can’t we all just get along - let bygones be bygones
Let humans be humans and let cylons be cylons

Without  personally comunicating anybody
And I don't wanna go deeper

Too weak, I'm even sick of rapping about it
Because my listeners prolly don't find it interesting
Literally cannot say anything more
But I can't exist long in such conditions
Cannot fulfil all of my ambitions
I'm not a rapper, I'm a musician
Opposition to the mass-opinion
Reach the agreement isn't difficult but nobody suceeds in it
Searching for the reasons the people look in the mirror
And the easiest way is to claim yourself guilty

Dices que eramos el uno para el otro
Siento decirte que no estoy de acuerdo

Po-po-poker, comencem igual
Sonem diferent perquè sonar com ells es un pal
Filosofia barata, madafaka, no anem de Sartre
Caiem sobre tu com un mate de Carter
El freestyle esta mes mort que 2pac
Portem l'estil nou creat amb flows antiquats
Mes penjat que el Vista, no volem cap llista
De raperos Sherlock que sol busquen tenir mes pistes

Portem el nou so, directe al teu cap
El rap mes cabró com els pases d'Steve Nash

Heu venut el vostre cul per quatre ties i una visa
Poker avisa, som la brisa que hipnotitza
Ens sobra massa flow però ens falta la guita

[Verse 3: Move Poker d'Asos]
Ens falta la guita, pizza a la matinada
Us sobra la pasta però us la mengeu doblada
Es cada parrafada llençada, tu que sabràs?
Com els metxeros del Daidis, us falla el gas

Odi mes odi, ja no sabeu que fer

We light up the candles
And this night, the early spring's breeze
Will decorate the love of two youths

Almost forgetting to be polite

Sharing some festivity with them

The third is for each other

Our love will never end, even if we're seperated by galaxies
The god of marriage will also feel our passion
Giving us all the blessings he has

He knew right then, he was too far from home
Oh... He was too far from home
She took his hand, and she lead on a long man's golden beach
They watched the waves til' they lied in the sand
They drove for miles and miles, on those twisty, turny roads
Higher and higher and higher, they climbed
On those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood Hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and rings
All those big city lights, in those high rolling hills. (High rolling hills.)
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

He headed west, cause' he felt a change would do good
See some old friends, so good for the soul
She had been on with her face, and would let it lead the way
He saw that face, and he lost all control
Ahwee...
He had lost all control
Night after night, day after day, on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night, staring down at the lights of LA
Wondering if he would ever go home

Het is de titelhouder van Bredase origine
In de categorie koude eliminatie na analyse intense observatie

‘K zie angst in je ogen denkende wie ik ben
Ik blaaste al mics toen jij nog met lego speelde
Toen jij al klaarkwam als ze je hoofd streelde
Toen jij zei: ‘da's lekker!` als je Barbie zag bewegen
Zes uur thuis moest zijn terwijl anderen bleven
Nu denk je dat je hip bent omdat je Mecca draagt
Jeans half hangt ja cap naar achteren staat
Shit ik ben de ontsteker van die reality bom
En jij een schandknaap achter centraal station

[Shockwave]
Ben als de massa 100 kils in een pappa
Zoals karton rip ik de doos ja van je mama
Breng drama, wordt groen van de straling gamma
Word ik woest pulp ik je dood tot een rooie kakka
‘T is feit geen fictie tele-tubbie Lala is je idool
Kom uit de kast kil je hoort me wel ja
Je doet èm al na bitch! Met de limp van oma
Ren en limpy je breincel zo klein als Stimpy
Hoes nemen je niet nee, door je kleine pikkie
Voel een beat-down van deze MC Shocky
Een team als Sjors en Sjimmie ben ik met de Braintje
Ik breng de pijn mijn woordrijm doorscheint je brein breng de donderslag
Mep je de kanker en lach met praal en pracht de woordenkracht is heavy
In Dutch dodelijk in Engels deadly
Gasten horen het en zeggen: ‘Shock is fokking gek, G`

Ken je me nog? hier is Yukkie
Nu nog lekkerder als een koekie heter als een pornoboekie
Een schurk met talent en ik beklim de hitparade
Sla je gade, vervolgens sla ik toe zonder genade
Ik boei muzikale volk en ik boei en ik snoei m`n haren
Als het moet of doe een pet op of een hoed
Niet kaal maar ook niet kammen waar ik kom zijn rook en vlammen
Met de beats die uit de speakers rammen mijn raps doen jou verlammen
Tref je met techniek en vaardigheid m'n rap die snijd
Scherp als een mes en wat je krijgt is kwaliteit
Geen spijt waar voor je geld is wat je krijgt
Dus wees bereid want Yukkie B. die komt met vaardigheid
Dus paas de wiet, vloei en filter ik zweef als een vlinder
De microfoonverslinder ik ben de buitvinder
Een harde werker ik zweet voor elke cent
Maak het nieuws maar bekend mijn techniek is ongekend
Een echte vent, voor sommigen onbekend maar niet voor lang
Ik ben van plan om dit te doen voor de rest van de tijd die mij resteert
Yukkie B. presteert en presenteert smaak voor je oren die je niet zo snel verteert
Dus wat nou, wat had je dan? kom maar op
Ik eet je op als zoute drop en zet de zaal op zijn kop
Van de straat naar de top eronder of erop
De groetjes uit Amsterdam Oost en ik stap op

Je bent fleurig en iel met knullig gepiel een lullige kil
Zonder een bril maar sikkeneurig en scheel
Voor mijn neus ben je keurig en stil verhul je veel
Achter mijn rug doe je stoer en stug verlul je teveel
Dus zeur niet en chill gebeurde for real What the deal?
Bang voor mijn raps één woord het verscheurde je ziel
Je denkt meteen: ‘ik stop met rappen` en wil de hort op met sletten
Je zit niet op te letten ongeremde tracks ze zijn niet stop te zetten
Hou op met kleppen stop met neppen fokking faggots
Zal je kop verleppen mocht je het nog opbrengen om op te steppen
Neem wat Red Bull, Coke & Dr. Pepper om je op te peppen
Bent dommer dan maar één zender hebben en toch zappen
Beats van langere duur die je hoort als ik rap
Je ruilt je apparatuur dan maar weer om voor een step
Daar kom je verder mee en ermee weg als een vette slee
Je was niet eens slim als Eminem al je rapjes deed
Je denkt: ‘hee, daar komt de Braniac aan
Zoveel sporen verdiend 'k heb mengtafels op mijn rekening staan
Men wordt nog steeds genaaid kom echt niet klagen
En fuck DJs met lompe platen vj`s met domme vragen
Dus als je dit dist omdat brainiac weet wat de shit is of omdat ‘ie wit is
Dat ‘ie weet wat credible en wat een hit is
Lyrically fit is middels ille zinnen en bussiness

Jak nie kumasz tego chłopcze to się lepiej przyzwyczaj
Ja i moi ludzie, ja i ludzie moi
RPK wypuszcza dres kozak jest bez paranoi
Dwoi i się i troi coraz więcej jest tego
Zajebisty sort, sort to dresowy styl kolego
Nie pytam dlaczego jak kiedyś tak i dziś
Rzucam szelest koncert, melanż, melanż, koncert i jest git
Człowiek Kilo, lisi spryt, ogarniam swoje sprawy
Wszystko sweet, gra gitara ta taki wrodzony nawyk
Ponad kilo styl warszawy, dla dobrych ludzi słowo
Z farcikiem koleżko leć, leć do przodu aby z głową

[Zwrotka 4: Narczyk]
Siedzę na rejonie, jak zawsze gibon płonie
RPK, Ciemna Strefa, dresowy styl co nie
Orzeł w kornie, ta tutaj się lata
Za brata palę bata, kozak sorcik co wymiata
Atak na tracki, zajebista muza
Posłuchaj tego głosu, on z podziemia się wynurza
RPK grube lolo Ciemna Strefa, też tu jest

Miasto [?] A dzielnica bloki
To tutaj na sportowo stawiam swoje kroki
Cisnę po ulicy i psy się trafiają
Szybko leżę na glebie i dresik mi wiskają
Ja leżę i się śmieję, bo i tak nic nie znajdą
Jedynie po złości na komendę mnie zgarną
Chujowa perspektywa na dzisiejszy wieczór
Poszedłbym inną ścieżką gdybym akcje przeczuł
Jednak fart mnie nie opuszcza i kurwy mnie puszczają
Przez szczekaczkę meldują, że interwencję mają
Podnoszę się z ziemi i idę wkurwiony
Że nie dało się przejść niezauważonym
Ustawka z chłopakami i płoną historie
Następne doświadczenie mam na to swą teorię
Życie jak życie raz na dole raz na górze
Mogłeś psie lepiej szukać bo miałem w kapturze

[Zwrotka 6: Warunia]
Dres, dres, dres dzień jak co dzień w to odziany
Przemierzam osiedla jak zawsze ujarany
Kombinacje, wały, patenty na hajs
Melanż z ziomalami jest dla mnie jak raj
Przy tym dobry rap który skłania do przemyśleń
Pierdolić policję to chyba oczywiste...

Boli mnie tu czasem, że nie jesteś tu ze mną
Wszyscy się pytali co u ciebie tak jest
Przez lata już nie mieliśmy nic razem wspólnego
Czasem myśli mnie doprowadzają do łez
Byłem małolatem co zaczynał nawijać
Pomogłeś mi napisać tutaj pierwszy mój tekst
Mówiłeś gnojom żeby się przestali zabijać
Kochałeś nas jak młodszych braci - łączy nas krew
Na zawsze dla mnie będziesz częścią mojej rodziny
Za ciebie z nami niedługo wypije twój syn
Nikt z nich prawie nie obczajał twojej rozkminy
Byłeś jak Big Pun, jak składałeś ten rym

Mój człowiek już jest w niebie z aniołami, a my
Dalej na ulicach i balety do rana
Wylewam tu szampana żebyś wiecznie nam żył

Jak miałem dziewięć lat byłeś dla mnie jak ojciec
Mieszkaliśmy w Berlinie, a ty byłeś tu sam
Rodzice po rozwodzie, mamy zero na koncie
Odkąd tata nas zostawił - ja bym wolał być tam
W Warszawie pójść do szkoły i pomieszkać u dziadka
On jako jedyny nigdy na nas się nie darł
Pamiętam jak wróciłem na rowerze do domu
I matka mi ze łzami w oczach mówi, że zmarł
Taki jest nasz los kiedy świat opuszczamy
Wszystko co kochamy zabierze nam czas
Z wiekiem nauczyłem się być dobrym dla mamy
Bo wiem, że gdy odejdzie to mi będzie jej brak
Muszę dbać o zdrowie, żeby być tu dla dzieci
By móc je wychować i pokazać ten świat
Nie zamienię miłości dla żadnych pieniędzy
Obojętnie ile kiedy kto by mi dał

German translation:

[Strophe 1: Sentino]
Es schmerzt mich hier manchmal, dass du nicht hier bei mir bist
Alle haben sich gefragt, was bei dir so geht
Im Laufe der Jahre hatten wir nichts mehr gemeinsam
Manchmal treiben meine Gedanken mir Tränen ins Gesicht
Ich war ein Teenager, der anfing aufzunehmen
Du hast mir geholfen, hier meinen ersten Text zu schreiben
Du hast den Pennern gesagt, dass sie aufhören sollen sich umzubringen
Du hast uns geliebt wie deine jüngeren Brüder - uns vereint das Blut
Du wirst für immer ein Teil meiner Familie bleiben
Bald trinkt Dein Sohn anstelle von Dir einen mit uns
Fast nichts hat sie so viel gelehrt wie deine Ausführungen
Du warst wie Big Pun, als Du die Reime zusammengesetzt hast
KMC for Life und Big Sal ist mein Mann und
Mein Mann ist schon im Himmel bei den Engeln, und wir
Weiter auf den Straßen und Party bis in den Morgen
Ich gieße hier Champagner damit Du ewig lebst

[Refrain: Sentino]
Lass uns ein wenig mehr Zeit
Alle werden ständig von der Zeit gejagt
Vergiss nie, wie
Andere Dir geholfen haben aufzustehen
Das ist für alle Soldaten, die gestorben sind
Auf der Jagd nach einem Traum und sie gingen zu früh
Ich werde meine Familie nicht für Schätze verletzen
Und werde sie nirgendwo hinnehmen - ich werde nicht ewig leben
[Strophe 2: Sentino]
Als ich etwa neun Jahre alt war, warst Du wie ein Vater für mich
Ich lebte in Berlin und Du warst hier ganz allein
Eltern waren frisch geschieden, wir haben nichts auf dem Konto
Papa hat uns verlassen - ich wäre lieber dort
In Warschau zur Schule gehen und bei Opa wohnen
Er war der einzige der uns niemals anschrie
Ich erinnere mich, wie ich auf dem Fahrrad nach Hause kam
Und meine Mutter mir mit Tränen in den Augen sagte, dass er starb
So ist unser Schicksal, wenn wir die Welt verlassen
Alles was wir lieben, nimmt uns die Zeit
Mit dem Alter habe ich gelernt, gut zu meiner Mama zu sein
Weil ich weiß, dass sie mir fehlen wird, wenn sie uns verlässt
Ich muss auf meine Gesundheit achten, um hier für die Kinder da zu sein
Um sie erziehen zu können, und ihnen die Welt zu zeigen
Ich tausche Liebe gegen kein Geld der Welt
Egal wieviel mir wannimmer, werauchimmer geben würde

So we burning cities down
And take whatever we want

Thick ass and full lips
Fried chicken and hot grits
Watermelon and hot chips

UniversAlmente Te,rap,Slaky,99.0,"[Intro]
Sai.. ti penso sempre
Quando mi sveglio
La mattina, il pomeriggio
La sera e la notte
Ma se dormo? Ti sogno..
Non ti piace la tua voce
Ma la riconoscerei
Tra quella di un milione di persone
E la userei come una lunga canzone di motivazione
Poi la ascolterei in cuffia tra la colazione e la stazione
Ma poi staccherei per seguire la lezione
Ore e ore, per il nostro futuro
Il nostro onore.. il nostro amore

[Strofa]
Si, che me la prendo e chiedo scusa
Se non ti rendo orgogliosa
Anche se è per le mie scarpe scarse
Se non ne so fare tante
All'istante vorrei rimediare
A tutte ste cazzate
Che si sono corazzate
Per me si sono frustate
Scegliere qualcosa
Per renderti orgogliosa
Una macchina noiosa
Non ti piace il rosa
Fare versi in prosa
Vederti da sposa
Hai il potere di cambiare il mio umore
In un momento minore
Di una sola pulsazione
Del mio cuore
Se non muore
Questo sole
Sto con te
Per la durata
Di un fotone
Che ossessione
Essenziale
Come il sole
Un po' banale
Non ti sorprende più niente
Ma è normale
Un po' come
Trascurare
Tutti e tutto
Perchè mi basti tu, so
Che poi non è giusto
Ma non freno l'impulso
I tuoi spasmi quando dormi
Vorrei vederli, tutti i giorni
Sentirli la notte, poi dirti le botte
Che mi hai dato la mattina, china la tua testolina
Su di me, stammi vicina
Poi ci alziamo, compensiamo
Ci diciamo ti amo
Andiamo a fare colazione, sei come
La sola isola, non inquinata, salvaguardata
Hai perdonato sto cretino bambino un casino di volte
Ma il destino risorge, a me ha fatto più forte
A te ha dato
Mille botte
Giornate storte
E pure molte
Infinite avvolte
Nelle tue folte
Tristi gocce dolce lieto fine, lieto fine, lieto fine
Ma alla fine
Io creo problemi, tu risolvi, evolvi ogni cosa
Mia rosa
Sei la mia musa che uso per la mia vita fusa
Riempita da vuota
Sei stata l'unica che ha accettato
Ogni difetto scontato
Dopo averlo destato stato che ho cambiato
Dopo che ho capito che
Mi hai salvato
Ti ho amato sempre
Ma non capivo niente
Neanche l'inno vivente
Nella mia mente..

Infinitamente te

So This Is Magic,pop,Hanna Ross,10.0,"[Verse 1]
This looks like a place where
Somebody'd hang little lights amongst the trees
This looks like a place where secrets are kept
And worries quelled and gone with the breeze
So this is magic
This is my place to think
Deep in the heart of this grand forest
The sun paints the sky pink

[Pre-Chorus]
And the arms of the redwoods
Are strong and never tremble
Even when the wind comes and knocks on their trunks
They stand tall amongst the shambles
On nights like these I can look up at the sky
And my answers are written in the stars
And I can sing and feel a glittering hope
Bubbling up within my heart

[Chorus]
So this is magic
Now I understand Galileo Galilei
I just wanna spend one night here safe in the arms of the trees
So this is magic
It's passion on my sleeve
It's writing a song and not being afraid of how one perceives your words to be
So this is magic
So this is magic
[Verse 2]
I don't have to hide here
Because I'm hidden in the fringe of the branches
And when I sing my song the world approves
And the summer wind dances

[Pre-Chorus]
And this sleepy hollow holds me
And history once told me
That it's funny how your mind can make the past seem so much better than it was

[Chorus]
So this is magic
Now I understand Galileo Galilei
I just wanna spend one night here safe in the arms of the trees
So this is magic
It's passion on my sleeve
It's writing a song and not being afraid of how one perceives your words to be
So this is magic
So this is magic

[Bridge]
I can be afraid if I want to be
And I can be so brave if I want to be
And I can see the starlight guiding me
Oooh

So this is magic
Now I understand Galileo Galilei
I just wanna spend one night here safe in the arms of the trees
So this is magic
It's passion on my sleeve
It's writing a song and not being afraid of how one perceives your words to be
So this is magic
So this is magic

I can be afraid if I want to be
And I can be so brave if I want to be
And I can see the starlight guiding me
And I can feel that it's alright, this is how it's supposed to be
I can be afraid if I want to be
And I can be so brave if I want to be
I can see the starlight guiding me
I try to catch it

La del Estribo,rap,Apache & Canserbero,30483.0,"[Letra de ""La del Estribo""]

[Parte I]

[Verso 1: Canserbero]
No solo es Apa y Can, es Kpu y Afro, carajo
Odiar este trabajo es demostrar que eres un gafo
Afónica marea que acarrea mi voz fea
Aunque mejor que la diarrea que su bella voz florea o cacarea
Unstoppable flavor, el king de la selva
Por si no lo recuerdas, ¡if you can not remember!
Deberían darse en las bembas, con una piedra, manada de come mierdas
Lenguas largas, críticos de leyendas

[Verso 2: Apache]
Oye bro, esta unión es como Peña y Moisés Alou
Ponemos en esto como en un abierto del Roland Garros
Como en los noventa el 30-30 con su dembow
Los hacemos brincar más que en el exorcista de Emily Rose

[Coro: Apache]
Es Can y Apache, los del estilache que no dejan bache
Y lo apunten como la Central Hidroeléctrica de Cabache
La inyección letal desde la biblioteca musical
Invicto como Dominican en el clásico del mundial
[Verso 3: Canserbero]
El negro y el catirrucio sucio, aspecto de percusio'
No tanto como Confusio', pero del coco hago uso
(Hey you que abuso!) Que se encaramen con el prepucio
Y lo mamen como lambucio... Ok, perdón perdón
Son demasiados pasos más que ustedes o no pueden
Somos los crueles que dictan los niveles que romper ever

[Parte II]

[Verso 1: Canserbero; Apache]
Ante sus Mercedes, es rap real para las redes
Rimas de asalto que van como el parkour por las paredes
Como el negro Kimbo Slice mis entradas aquí son mortales
Como Mike con la Highfly, como Tito con los timbales
¡Magistral! Magnífico, épico y apoteósico
A propósito, pa' que parásitos cierren el hocico

[Verso 2: Canserbero; Apache]
¡Repámpanos!¡Que sádico suena tu léxico!
Es un narcotráfico de flow que no para el ejército
Llegamos como a las nueve, pero nos vamos como a las doce
Después nos vamos para el estudio, para que Herrera mezcle las voces
Every night, High too legalice disparando punchlines
Para meterle lírica bruta como Ken Brown o Josh Bridges
[Verso 3: Canserbero]
Es que ha de ser difícil el oficio de ser explicit pero alguien lo tiene que hacer
Es como andar en bici, y a mi si que me sale easy, ni siquiera lo busco hacer
¿No lo ves? Como Moisés cortamos mares
Pero de instrumentales reales no aptos para MC's normales

[Parte III]

[Verso 1: Apache]
Listen to the warrior, aquí somos varios en el crew
Afromak, el sonido sicario, y también está Kpu
En el track donde los protagonistas son los beatmakers
No vengan con fake que apunta de rap les bajamos los breakers
Así que vamos, canta, pon tus manos en alto
Coréala bien duro y si tú quieres pega salto
Vaya, levanta tu yesca y dale fire
Que haya lo que haya, aquí ya no estamos para dar papaya

[Verso 2: Canserbero]
Es flow que pisa como un bisonte, se cuela cual polizonte
Y de lo que digan, me importa un cuerno como al rinoceronte
Ponte pa' la tuya no se me vaya a equivocar ca'
Que a caballo vamos para el monte Can y A-P-A, nada más
Solo vengo de a poco, para que no se vuelvan locos
Si en mis tiempos libres río de sus discos y sus fotos
Por poco, dirán que colecciono haters
Que al final nuestro rap consume más que un fucking rolling paper
[Parte IV]

[Verso 1: Apache]
Es que no hay líneas que se escapen de las líneas de mi paper
No hay quien la boca nos tape y atrapen al don't stopped
Soy el rapper que hace que el público brinque y grite ""sape""
What happen? Es el A-P-A en el papi
Vueltas tranco, arranco y desde mi flanco brinco los zancos
Sobre el beat, jalando el kick y en el mic dando justo al blanco
Te soy franco, esto está clean, suena de pin, tiene un buen swing
Está en todas partes como las pompas de rose y el domplin

[Verso 2: Canserbero]
Señores y señoras, se despiden los que dan la hora
A punta de rimas de tórax sin caerle a cobas
Inevitable padre que nos agarre la moda
Y en todas partes se escuche, por primera vez, buen rap en la emisora
Es que se descontrola mezclando el anís con la piola
Y creen que uno es un aprendiz que supo de esto hace una hora
Luego ven como lloran, cuando les meto en la consola
Y no saben si lo que grabé fue un tema o una locomotora
Le aconsejo de cora', que mejor vire y se pire
Si lo que quiere es malinformar al kilombo o al catire
Para encima, voy segado, si equivocado te aproximas
Cuidado donde caminas o pisarás las minas y K-boom

[Verso 3: Apache]
¡Yeah! Esta es la música que nos hace sentir vivos
Si estamos aquí es por algún motivo
Es parte de la historia del rap lo que hoy escribo
Para ustedes esta fue la del estribo
Esto se pega y llega como a la moneda un imán
Te hace vibrar y te conecta con la letra, yeah man
Esto si es rap de Venezuela y suena ram-pan-pan
Desde el volcán, una vez más el del papiro y el Can

[Outro: Canserbero; Apache]

El rap de Venezuela tiene que agradecer por este junte
Den replay y apunte para que no olviden cuando les pregunten
Quienes hoy en día lideran la travesía y como ser los mejores seria
Una falta de cortesía les dejamos esa labor tediosa a los hermanos
Que solo aman la fama y no lo que representamos, ¿estamos?
¡Apa y el Chamo!

Tries pull it together and more on the fire

I'm always watching my back, best friends is fucking me over

Bitch like some hoes, who need some fucking dick and some closure
This world has gone to shit
And everyone inside disgust me, beautiful on the outside with actions that make them ugly

But is my goal to make the cover of the XXL?
Or fuck a thousand hoes until my dick starts to swell?
Or make a million mistakes and make some songs called ""Oh Well""?
Or glorify the drug game and put my people in jail?
And take full responsibility for a generation in cells
Cause all you fuckers influence the kids, with the stories you tell
While you fantasize like its heaven to be living in hell

Аромат твоих волос

Еду за тобой ты не лови такси
Ты без ума сидеть со мной

E cì lo sai (Già lo sai come va)
Quello Che Vi Consiglio! (È quello che penso)
Volume Due! (Stamme a senti' va)

[Strofa 1]
Gemitaiz, mando a fanculo il direttore
Rimo finché muore ogni stronzo disertore
Fumo 24 ore diesel, bevo finché il cuore mi si spegne
Come le speranze di chi c'ha un tumore
Sento quel rumore in testa a rallentatore
La gente si annienta io li spengo l'alimentatore
Ti muovi nella merda ci fai il modellatore
Il tuo posto per traditori come un motel a ore
Scopri che l'amore lo permette solo il senatore
Che nelle vene dal cuore agisce da generatore
Mette il tritolo in macchina all'imperatore
Trasmetto il dolore alla gerarchia dei senza cuore
Mando all'aria i tuoi piani faccio il sabotatore
Ma gli extra-comunitari e qualche lavoratore
Vedi venti tipi strani che ti alzano le mani e ti bruciano i divani
A te e al tuo capodatore
Persone che non hanno mai provato calore
Non credono alla favola della medaglia al valore
Te li ritrovi in banca con passamontagna e mitragliatore
E uno fuori in macchina che riscalda il motore
Qua l'umore sale e scende, è un equalizzatore
Della vittoria non mi ricordo più qual è il sapore
Cerco la scintilla, spingo come un caterpillar
Finché la vita mi dà scosse come un defibrillatore
Io sputo in faccia a Dio che è un allibratore
La palude siamo noi, lui l'unico alligatore
Ogni uomo col potere qua è un gran attore
Do le stecche come Cantatore a ogni cantautore
[Ritornello]
Vivo per la verità e questa qua è la mia
Vivo nel confine tra insanità e follia
Direttamente live, da camera mia
Frate', quello che ve consiglio è andare via

[Strofa 2]
Sennò finisci che qui ci rimani
Dopo che hai fatto sacrifici immani
Voglio sentirli i piani, c'ho i legami infranti
Perché siamo cantanti miliziani come gli inti-illimani
C'ho gli spilli nelle mani, è inutile che ti rintani
Vengo con zingari e gitani grossi come titani
Fumo etti mentre penso a quei maledetti infami
Che fingono di essere persone come i rettiliani
Ho capito che i tentativi so' stati vani
Sogno gli aeroplani che cascano sopra i Vaticani
Siamo pazzi sclerati ma siamo nati sani
Siete voi che ci avete fatto diventare tali
Pazzi proletari senza agganci monetari
Fatti persi che sognano viaggi interplanetari
Da Milano, Roma, Bari siamo tutti uguali
Tu, leggiti i giornali e credi a tutti quanti i notiziari
Io credo alle voci del quartiere e degli amici cari
Dei poveracci pugliesi, dei negri e dei siciliani
De quelli che in 'sti anni si sono avvicinati
Al concetto d'onestà a cui non siete abituati
Intanto il caldo sale, a ottantaquattro gradi
Che stai finendo te ne accorgi solo quando cadi
Siamo cappottati ed ogni problema sarà parte dello schema
Per cacciarci chiama gli avvocati

Vivo per la verità e questa qua è la mia
Vivo nel confine tra insanità e follia

Das Energi,rap,Asaiah Ziv,399.0,"[Intro]

I tried to think about the last ten years but I can hardly remember yesterday. When that first started to happen I wondered whether I had taken too many drugs. But then I noticed that when I needed something it was there. So I started to trust this state of not thinking at all, just kind of an empty mind. Out of which something comes and you just get to trust it

[Verse 1: Asaiah Ziv]

Tell me what's on your mind
Lately I don't give a...
You know I keep it lit
Don't pay attention to the... they be saying if it ain't truth
My mind full got me mindful
Now my generation getting blindfold
Someone tell me where the time go
I can only see the light when my eyes close
Nothing's important than doing right
The truth has already been in your sight
Affirmation of one’s life
They told me my destiny's hard to find
They told me the power is in the mind
We count every hour and every dime
Dismiss every message in every line
Let them know that them hating's a waste of time
I've been planting hella fruit, the truth is in the seed fool
You really need to read fool, you the puppet, they the string fool
[Hook: Asaiah Ziv]

Back then I was young, now I'm old
I don't do it for the money or the gold
Hands up when you see me at the shows
Hands up when you see me at the show [x2]

[Verse 2: Asaiah Ziv]

Collecting unemployment from my fans
I rotate on this axis, give you access to my plans
Hieroglyphics on the ceiling, I create them with my hands
I organize religion like the pastor's promo plans
It's partially the purpose ride the service, make the markets crash
Enter in the realm they claim is Hell, I wonder if I'll last
I wonder if I'll die will the people ask why?
Been inhaling hella smoke cause it's been helping me cope
I'm in a spot, where I can turn a rock into a diamond
Predict the future like I'm Mayan, contradict them like I'm lying
Sike, what's wrong from right? You left I'm right
You weak I'm tight, aight
It's been appealing for a reason gave a seasonal touch
They at the table tryna mingle, I ain't giving them lunch
Eat your heart out
I'm running like I'm [?], sweating like it's hot out
This is when I question your attention, are you paying enough?
Yeah, you sold a couple albums, is it paying enough?
The money coming in clutch
I been improving my chakra, half of the music is kaka
I'm blocking shots like Ibaka, I run the stocks like Obama
It's lit
[Hook: Asaiah Ziv]

Back then I was young, now I'm old
I don't do it for the money or the gold
Hands up when you see me at the shows
Hands up when you see me at the show [x2]

They say the truth supposed to set you free
Free your soul, free your mind

Esaïe 54:7 Quelques instants je t`avais abandonnée, Mais avec une grande affection je t`accueillerai;

Esaïe 54:8 Dans un instant de colère, je t`avais un moment dérobé ma face, Mais avec un amour éternel j`aurai compassion de toi, Dit ton rédempteur, l`Éternel.

Esaïe 54:9 Il en sera pour moi comme des eaux de Noé: J`avais juré que les eaux de Noé ne se répandraient plus sur la terre; Je jure de même de ne plus m`irriter contre toi Et de ne plus te menacer.

Esaïe 54:10 Quand les montagnes s`éloigneraient, Quand les collines chancelleraient, Mon amour ne s`éloignera point de toi, Et mon alliance de paix ne chancellera point, Dit l`Éternel, qui a compassion de toi.

Esaïe 54:11 Malheureuse, battue de la tempête, et que nul ne console! Voici, je garnirai tes pierres d`antimoine, Et je te donnerai des fondements de saphir;
Esaïe 54:12 Je ferai tes créneaux de rubis, Tes portes d`escarboucles, Et toute ton enceinte de pierres précieuses.

Esaïe 54:13 Tous tes fils seront disciples de l`Éternel, Et grande sera la postérité de tes fils.

Esaïe 54:14 Tu seras affermie par la justice; Bannis l`inquiétude, car tu n`as rien à craindre, Et la frayeur, car elle n`approchera pas de toi.

Esaïe 54:15 Si l`on forme des complots, cela ne viendra pas de moi; Quiconque se liguera contre toi tombera sous ton pouvoir.

Esaïe 54:16 Voici, j`ai créé l`ouvrier qui souffle le charbon au feu, Et qui fabrique une arme par son travail; Mais j`ai créé aussi le destructeur pour la briser.

Esaïe 54:17 Toute arme forgée contre toi sera sans effet; Et toute langue qui s`élèvera en justice contre toi, Tu la condamneras. Tel est l`héritage des serviteurs de l`Éternel, Tel est le salut qui leur viendra de moi, Dit l`Éternel.",0.635160855948925,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Child with the Star on His Head,rock,Sufjan Stevens,1603.0,"Positive Christmas energy, desperately seeking Santa, Take 3

Once in a while, you may think you see better than the others
Scrambling around in the dark with your drum
There is a time when young men must grow up and be brothers
Are you afraid of growing too fast?

And the child with the star on his head
All of the world rests on his shoulders
And the mother with the child on her breast
Blessed is she among women

And the trust we put in things
In small ideas, in engineering
The world of sports and second best
In consequences we will not put to rest

Why crawl around in the snow
When you know I am right here
Waiting for you to expect something more?
For I am warm, I am calling you close to my table
Where I have made us a feast
For the year of troubles, they have gone
The winter brings a Christmas song

And the child with the star on his head
All of the world rests on his shoulders
And the mother with the child on her breast
Blessed is she among women

Does all the world know better than
When Christmas comes the troubles end
The troubles end, the troubles end

And by the time there’s nothing left
An empty tree, a winter vest
A winter vest, a winter vest

And all the trust we put in things
In dictionaries, in engineering
In calendars, and television
In father's friends, in consequences",0.6465205007698387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I znów używam dwóch ruchomych blatów
Jeden mikrofon i największy atut
Inteligencja od pana światów
Tu z warsztatu ogłaszam alarm
Masz 5 minut bo na o pozwalam
Potem konkurencje na kolana powalam
Gdy moja płyta ujrzy światło dzienne
Chwyta serce rytm a siła we mnie
Mówię konkret ty cytujesz slogany
Ręce w górę to temat oklepany
Ja przytoczę fakty nie jak ty dissy
Twoje przemija mnie proszą o bisy
Mc dla mc wrogiem się staje
Kobiele zwą suką
Typ psa udaje
Ludzie jak ścierwa traktują się nawzajem
Rap gra wnerwia ale ja zostaje
Trzeba uważać z kim się nagrywa
Weźmie twój styl i przerobiona ksywa
Twój sukces obrazą nazywa
To sprawa obrzydliwa
To jest żałosne
Jak niezdolne osoby są zazdrosne
O to czego im brak
O mój postęp
Ja do studia niemal przyrosłem
Rosnę niczyim kosztem to takie proste
[Zwrotka 2]
Miasto płacze wyje syrena
Mówią o jedności a jej tu nie ma
Wielka ściema jak wielka scena
Szacunek do brata to trzeba mieć w genach
Co do ulicy niejeden twierdzi
To dom dosłownie to mi coś śmierdzi
Nie rozumiesz metafory to śmierć Ci
Tępa przemoc która na początku kręci
Alarm lokalny i dla świata
Kupujesz u pirata nie myśl że masz farta
Nie myśl też że to moja mała strata
To moja krew na tych kasetach i kompaktach
Szydzisz to se szydź i zgaśnij
Jesteś pozerem zerem bez wyobraźni
Ktoś jest lepszy i to cie drażni
Sepuku zrób bo sam żeś się zbłaźnił
Rap mój dom uszanuj gospodarza
Pokaż szacunek nie próbuj mnie obrażać
Nawet by pokazać tymczasową wyższość
Powiem pokój i zabiorę przyszłość

Kommt es mir so vor, als hätt ich Gottes Segen über mir
Hab' mich aus der Zelle in mei'm Kopf befreit
Mein Alter Ego war ein Bastard, doch ich hoff' nur, dass mir Gott verzeiht
Ich hab' verstanden, dass unsere Schwächen Stärken sind
Fick' die Maskerade, Mann, ich zeig' den Leuten, wer ich bin
Zeig' den Leuten, dass mein Leben jahrelang gefickt war
Lak, wie oft hab' ich abends meine Scharfe schon entsichert?
Lass' mich nicht von irgendwelchen Pennern unterdrücken
Die mir reden vom Islam, aber gerne Mütter ficken
Mir egal, ob mit den Bull'n oder 'ner Kugel in dein Kopf
Chaye, du bist nicht mit Gott, du bist skrupelloser Schrott
Zuhause war die Hölle los, um mich rum nur Haifische
Doch anscheinend war ich nicht der Einzige
Für so einige war „Sieben Jahre“ ein Heilmittel
Ich bin für jeden von euch da, also schreibt mir bitte
„100 Bars Final Kill“, viele hab'n mich provoziert
Aber PA hat sich alles irgendwo notiert
Anstatt auf Instagram zu bellen wie ein hohles Tier
Hab' ich mich im Studio auf die Zerfickung fokussiert
Aus irgendeinem Grund hat nur Manuel angebissen
Obwohl ich niemals dran gedacht hab', diesen Mann zu dissen
Drückt mit seiner Reaktion auf meinen wunden Punkt
Doch ich klär' das mit Gehirn, brauche keine hundert Jungs
Ich send' dir Liebe, Bruder, denn ich kenn' dein echtes Ich
Ich denke, vielen ist bewusst, dass du kein Schlechter bist
Warum verkaufst du deinen Traum gegen Verbrecher-Shit
Obwohl du so ein krasser Rapper bist?
Die Straße rief uns nie, nein, wir wollten selber hin
Weil wir dachten, dass diese ganzen Idioten Helden sind
Wahre Reflektion sollte immer bei ei'm selbst beginn'n
Müssen uns entscheiden, ob wir Gangster oder Eltern sind
Das Statement ging viral, ja, die Leute rasten aus
Yeah, denn dieser PA hat sich was getraut
Getraut zu sagen, dass ich fertig mit der Scheiße bin
Und mit dreißig Jahren nie mehr handel' wie ein kleines Kind
Auf einmal kam Capi, er reichte mir die Hand
Und nach dem ersten Feature hing'n die meisten an mei'm Schwanz
Ich weiß, dass diese Zeile hier beleidigend sein kann
Doch der Drang nach bisschen Hype macht euch einfach nur noch krank
Hab' schon immer gut gerappt, packte Seele in die Tracks
Und dennoch bekam LiP den wenigsten Respekt
Mann, ich kann euch nur verachten und das geht auch nicht mehr weg
Aber macht euch keine Sorgen, bin zu jedem von euch nett
Doch behalt' im Hinterkopf, dass ihr kleine Fotzen seid
Und nur angeschissen kommt, weil ihr denkt, jetzt folgt der Hype
Doch sollt es nicht so kommen, seid ihr alle wieder weg
Deutsche Rapper heutzutage sind charakterlicher Dreck
Hab' im Gegensatz zu euch vor einer Kahba mehr Respekt
Für wie dumm ihr manche haltet, ist das, was ein'n so verletzt
So ein Maskhara-Geschäft, ihr habt keine Leidenschaft
Alles Propaganda, wenn ihr Lollis auf bescheiden macht
Ihr seid keine Künstler, Hip-Hop ist euch scheißegal
Und deshalb vergeh'n alle eure Hypes in einem Jahr
Capi, Bruder, das, was du gegeben hast
Bekam ich nicht einmal von Brüdern, mit denen ich vorher schon Jahrzehnte war
Mir ist bewusst, dass du den nächsten Step geebnet hast
Für mich und meine Jungs und dafür dank' ich dir ein Leben lang
Manchmal kommt es mir so vor, als wär'n wir seelenverwandt
Denn Bruderherz, wir beide sind ein'n sehr ähnlichen Weg gegang'n
Du bist ein Ehrenmann, wallah, Bro, wir lieben dich
Wenn einer dissen will, wird seine Mutter auf dem Beat gefickt
Wünsch' mir für uns beide, dass uns Allah unsern Frieden gibt
Gnade Gott demjenigen, der jemals auf uns schießen wird
Uns verbindet einiges, weil wir meistens alleine sind
Und leider viel zu wenig Zeit verbring'n mit unsern kleinen Kids
Kamen aus dem Battlerap und hab'n die Szene attackiert
Ein paar Jahre später wollten Unterdrücker abkassier'n
Haargenau dieselbe Story, doch wer will uns abrasier'n?
Alle sind gefickt, wenn der CEO zum Bratan wird
Gegensätze zieh'n sich an, Bra, ich weiß, du fühlst die Sätze
Sind wir zwei im Bela-Mode, bleiben von euch nur Überreste
Hip-Hop ist 'ne Bubble und die Kreise sind geschlossen
Denn nur mit einem Blick seh' ich den Neid in diesen Fotzen
Der Zug ist abgefahr'n, ich scheiß' auf jeden von euch Pissern
Ein Feature mit PA wäre 'ne Ehre für euch Pisser
Meine Legacy wiegt mehr als die Karriere von euch Pissern
Vielleicht werdet ihr Männer, ja, ich bete für euch Pisser
Wir sind musikalisch Champs, ob mit Rappen oder Autotune
Ihr könnt mir alles nehm'n, doch mein Ziel erreich' ich auch zu Fuß
Hab' mein halbes Leben nach einer richtigen Frau gesucht
Doch was Liebe angeht, bin ich schon seit Jahren auf Entzug
Hätte nie gedacht, dass ich meinen eigenen Traum verfluch'
Bin genau wie du nur ein Bruder, der sein Zuhause sucht
Doch es heißt immer wieder, ich wär nicht beziehungsfähig
Bin in meinem Krieg gefang'n und gebe deshalb viel zu wenig
Doch wo ist die Person, die meine Kriege mit mir kämpft?
Ich meine die, die Parham haben will und nicht den Benz
Ich meine die, die meine Seele eines Tages heilt
Hätt ich das gewusst, hätt ich mir nie gewünscht, ein Star zu sein
Meine Prinzessin hat noch nie geseh'n, wie ihr Vater weint
Doch es war ein harter Fight, sieben Jahre Qual und Leid
Wir sind verbunden, wenn du über diese Narben streichst
Was ein gutes Feeling, endlich wieder da zu sein

I flex on these nxggas like Yoshi
I feel like a young master Roshi
Tryna find me a young goddess
I’m hypnotized caught up in her hotness
Baby girl know that she the hottest
Caught in the web I’m just being honest
Running for the ring... man I feel like Sonic
I’m high off the doja
Her love got me so lost
I’m facing the final boss
I’m willing to pay the cost
Baby girl you so gothic
Damn girl you so godly
That ass got me like golly
Look at god how he blessing me

In love wit her voice & the sound of her tone
Knew it was mine by the way that she moan
My shorty my flower I water her
I planted the seed and I grow with her
Ain’t nowhere I don’t wanna go with her
I got her and will not let go of her
Know she miss me well tell me what else is new
Know daddy be working & shorty too
I love how she grind and stay active

She give up the top without asking

There was a time when in the teeth of fate,misc,George Santayana,8.0,"There was a time when in the teeth of fate
I flung the challenge of the spirit's right;
The child, the dreamer of that visioned night,
Woke, and was humbled unto man's estate.
A slave I am; on sun and moon I wait,
Who heed not that I live upon their light.
Me they despise, but are themselves so bright
They flood my heart with love, and quench my hate.
O subtle Beauty, sweet persuasive worth
That didst the love of being first inspire,
We do thee homage both in death and birth.
Thirsting for thee, we die in thy great dearth,
Or borrow breath of infinite desire
To chase thine image through the haunted earth.",0.9594009169377387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Koi To Andhere Me Dekha Mujhe Ummidoka Torch
Koi To Samje Mujhe Kare Mujhe Thoda To Support
And Missingly Usne Bheja Mujhe Khushiyonka Box

Baat Bhi Nai Karta Tha Kisise Dhang Se
Phir Tujhe Jariya Banake Aaya One Day

And Mil Gaye Mujhe Tere Panje

Maangi Thi Bas Rabse Ji Ne Ki Ek Wajah
Sunli Usne Meri Ye Pihu

Aate Mere Hero Ko 40 Se Jyada Tricks
Kuch Bhi Karne Lagta Hai For Drinks Aur Biscuits
Sabko Sona Rehta Hai But Sir Ko Baithna Sab Ke Beech
Daante To Bhi Sunta Kaha Hai Mota Saala deet
Bhag Jata Hai Chudake Apna Lish
Phir Gande Pairo Se Kharab
Kardega Sofa Aur Bedsheet

Marne Ke Liye Jaise Hi Dad Late Apne Stick
Pata Leta Hai Dete Apne Gile Gile Kiss
Jab Bhi Chalta Hai Aisa Lagta Hai Aaya Koi Dost
Saare Female Marti Hai Sabko Lagta Hai Cute

Sab Usko Rejaati Hai Aur Hilati Hai Apna Poonch
Sabke Ghar Me Chode Thode Aise Sabot

Kisika Chaba Jaaye Vo Purse Ya Kharab Ho Kaali Shirt

Gharme Na Aana Tu Oye Agar Problem Hai With My Boy
Tum Baadme Ho Saale Hancock Ka Ghar Hai Ye First
Koi Powerrage Banke Mujhe Mila Tha Sabot
Kabhi Toofanoke Beechme Aayegi Yeh Dhoop

Jaise Hi Suna Meri Body Hogayi Sun
Chakkar Se Aane Lagi Aur Aankho Me Aagyi Dhool
Rona Tha Par Par Nikla Nai Aasu Ka Ek Bhi Bund
Puchna Tha Mom Kaise Hai For Somehow I Just Couldn`t

Kya Kiya Be Tune Mere Hangoli Ke Saath
Chotu Bola Pata Nai Kya Hua Raato Raaat
Hospital Bhi Le Gaye The But Shuru Bhi Hua Tha Ilaaj
Par Bhaiyya Ek Dum Se Hanki Ne Lena Band Kardiya Tha Saas

Shayad Tujhe Akele Karke Nai Jana Tha Beta Ghar
Tu Takleef Me Tha But Nai Aaya Vo Nazar
Humare Pyaar Me Reh Gayi Thi Koi Kasar
Hume Gandi Lag Gayi Thi Kisi Ki Nazar
Aake Aise Chala Gayatu Jaiso Ho Koi Dream
Socha Nai Kya Hoga Humara Matlabi Saale Mean
Saara Saman Jagah Pe Hai Aur Gharbhi Ek Dum Clean
Par Man Nai Karta Ghar Jaaaneka Mote Tere Bin

Har Jagah Par Tere Nishaan Tere Suke Laalke
Koi Karne Wala Nai Hai Chidre Akbaar Ke
Garden Me Sukhe Saare Paudhe Susu Ke Dhaad Se
Kabhi Jayenge Nai Gharpe Tere Aise Mark Hai

Tere Videos Dekhte Rehte Hai Lagake Loop Me
Kuch Kar Nai Paaye Aur Rote Hai Saaare Usi Dukh Me
Janta Hu Shaane Sun Raha Hai Me Jaanta Hu Tujhe Khoob Me
Wapis Aana Aah Kisi Puppy Roop Me

Na Hoke Bhi Maujudu Tu Dil Me Hai Tu Bas Iss Tarah

We Will Not Go Down Song for Gaza,pop,Michael Heart,20249.0,"A blinding flash of white light
Lit up the sky over Gaza tonight
People running for cover
Not knowing whether they’re dead or alive

They came with their tanks and their planes
With ravaging fiery flames
And nothing remains
Just a voice rising up in the smoky haze

We will not go down
In the night, without a fight
You can burn up our mosques and our homes and our schools
But our spirit will never die
We will not go down
In Gaza tonight

Women and children alike
Murdered and massacred night after night
While the so-called leaders of countries afar
Debated on who’s wrong or right
But their powerless words were in vain
And the bombs fell down like acid rain
But through the tears and the blood and the pain
You can still hear that voice through the smoky haze

We will not go down
In the night, without a fight
You can burn up our mosques and our homes and our schools
But our spirit will never die
We will not go down

The Red Badge of Courage Chap. 15,misc,Stephen Crane,195.0,"         The regiment was standing at order arms at the side of a lane, waiting for the command to march, when suddenly the youth remembered the little packet enwrapped in a faded yellow envelope which the loud young soldier with lugubrious words had intrusted to him.

It made him start. He uttered an exclamation and turned toward his comrade.

        ""Wilson!""

        ""What?""

        His friend, at his side in the ranks, was thoughtfully staring down the road. From some cause his expression was at that moment very meek. The youth, regarding him with sidelong glances, felt impelled to change his purpose. ""Oh, nothing,"" he said.

        His friend turned his head in some surprise, ""Why, what was yeh goin' t' say?""

        ""Oh, nothing,"" repeated the youth.

        He resolved not to deal the little blow. It was sufficient that the fact made him glad. It was not necessary to knock his friend on the head with the misguided packet.

        He had been possessed of much fear of his friend, for he saw how easily questionings could make holes in his feelings. Lately, he had assured himself that the altered comrade would not tantalize him with a persistent curiosity, but he felt certain that during the first period of leisure his friend would ask him to relate his adventures of the previous day.

        He now rejoiced in the possession of a small weapon with which he could prostrate his comrade at the first signs of a cross-examination. He was master. It would now be he who could laugh and shoot the shafts of derision.

        The friend had, in a weak hour, spoken with sobs of his own death. He had delivered a melancholy oration previous to his funeral, and had doubtless in the packet of letters, presented various keepsakes to relatives. But he had not died, and thus he had delivered himself into the hands of the youth.
        The latter felt immensely superior to his friend, but he inclined to condescension. He adopted toward him an air of patronizing good humor.

        His self-pride was now entirely restored. In the shade of its flourishing growth he stood with braced and self-confident legs, and since nothing could now be discovered he did not shrink from an encounter with the eyes of judges, and allowed no thoughts of his own to keep him from an attitude of manfulness. He had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man.

        Indeed, when he remembered his fortunes of yesterday, and looked at them from a distance he began to see something fine there. He had license to be pompous and veteranlike.

        His panting agonies of the past he put out of his sight.

        In the present, he declared to himself that it was only the doomed and the damned who roared with sincerity at circumstance. Few but they ever did it. A man with a full stomach and the respect of his fellows had no business to scold about anything that he might think to be wrong in the ways of the universe, or even with the ways of society. Let the unfortunates rail; the others may play marbles.

        He did not give a great deal of thought to these battles that lay directly before him. It was not essential that he should plan his ways in regard to them. He had been taught that many obligations of a life were easily avoided. The lessons of yesterday had been that retribution was a laggard and blind. With these facts before him he did not deem it necessary that he should become feverish over the possibilities of the ensuing twenty-four hours. He could leave much to chance. Besides, a faith in himself had secretly blossomed. There was a little flower of confidence growing within him. He was now a man of experience. He had been out among the dragons, he said, and he assured himself that they were not so hideous as he had imagined them. Also, they were inaccurate; they did not sting with precision. A stout heart often defied, and defying, escaped.

        And, furthermore, how could they kill him who was the chosen of gods and doomed to greatness?

        He remembered how some of the men had run from the battle. As he recalled their terror-struck faces he felt a scorn for them. They had surely been more fleet and more wild than was absolutely necessary. They were weak mortals. As for himself, he had fled with discretion and dignity.

        He was aroused from this reverie by his friend, who, having hitched about nervously and blinked at the trees for a time, suddenly coughed in an introductory way, and spoke.

        ""Fleming!""

        ""What?""

        The friend put his hand up to his mouth and coughed again. He fidgeted in his jacket.

        ""Well,"" he gulped at last, ""I guess yeh might as well give me back them letters."" Dark, prickling blood had flushed into his cheeks and brow.
        ""All right, Wilson,"" said the youth. He loosened two buttons of his coat, thrust in his hand, and brought forth the packet. As he extended it to his friend the latter's face was turned from him.

        He had been slow in the act of producing the packet because during it he had been trying to invent a remarkable comment on the affair. He could conjure up nothing of sufficient point. He was compelled to allow his friend to escape unmolested with his packet. And for this he took unto himself considerable credit. It was a generous thing.

        His friend at his side seemed suffering great shame. As he contemplated him, the youth felt his heart grow more strong and stout. He had never been compelled to blush in such manner for his acts; he was an individual of extraordinary virtues.

        He reflected, with condescending pity: ""Too bad! Too bad! The poor devil, it makes him feel tough!""

        After this incident, and as he reviewed the battle pictures he had seen, he felt quite competent to return home and make the hearts of the people glow with stories of war. He could see himself in a room of warm tints telling tales to listener. He could exhibit laurels. They were insignificant; still, in a district where laurels were infrequent, they might shine.

        He saw his gaping audience picturing him as the central figure in blazing scenes. And he imagined the consternation and the ejaculations of his mother and the young lady at the seminary as they drank his recitals. Their vague feminine formula for beloved ones doing brave deeds on the field of battle without risk of life would be destroyed.",0.48377823069070774,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Perfect Gift,rap,Bishop Nehru,139.0,"[Intro]

[Verse]
Living in the matrix, the fakers call it reality
If it ain't for the ladies, they changing just for the salary
It saddens me
You actually thinking that they could rap with me
These emcees square with my energy is attached to beats
It's lyrical catastrophe, you and your spirit experience atrophy
No gimmicks, this my heart's masterpiece
No limit mind from the start like Master P
He's so gifted, others subpar, subtract 'em please
And anything shines in the dark so these rappers gleam
Give it time, when it comes to art it ain't what it seems
A different kind, set myself apart then I raise the beams
Too refined, swimming with the sharks made a greater being
I'm blowing on steam with a point like decimals
I'm here for two different streams, revenue and better views
I learned that they respect you when you aren't as accessible
Time is of the essence so I'm blessed in the selective few
I got bigger dreams
Cold world but I'm switching scenes
Made fiends like nicotine
And I run shit like the British queen
I'm a don with it and it's obvious
Y'all are not ever getting inbetween
Wild with it, he wild with it
Hoes style different like sitting clean
Since cargos and fros, know the kid been in his bag
We go toe to toe and your tibia will snap
Hat to the back like he Ash Ketchum with the swag
Step back but attack
He precise plotting on his wrath
I'm a master of self knowledge
They watching, they amazed
My thoughts are a maze, made the way and now they afraid
They weren't this worried when this king was a mere slave
I'm moving like a prophet while I'm making my own page
When I was just a teen with a dream, I seen 'em laugh at me
Now they all hit me asking to get on a track with me
Humanity just isn't enough, this for the casualties
I'm on Mount Olympus and I'm witnessing the tragedy
He kinda like Max B meets a bit of Perseus trying to free the youth
I see 'em move with every word I spit
If they don't have a clue, it's nothing new, I let 'em search for it
This dude is about to fuel their whole mood like the perfect gift, bitch

20 Feet Tall Remix,rap,9th Wonder,167.0,"[Intro: Rapsody]
Yo
Yo

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Know I gotta be the bigger person
Twenty feet over walls, curtains
I stand tall, two and a half Ervings
Julius magic, we made their Merlin
Got me up early here this morning, urgent
Sick, asserting, a family, we birthed it
Turban, wrapped my head around it, Berlin
Walls, you look between our plans and all
Searching for answers whether big or small
Why you want a piece? Bounce, basketball
Have I become old news? Analog
In a digital world, so fashion fall
Out of love, night flights, no gas at all
And 'til we crash, burn, awaiting calls
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
I'm over it, off the wall like Mike
Your attitude's rude, that and all the fights
Tryna figure where you were, away from home last night
Rolodex into memories, recall your type
Once before I met around 2004
I told myself ""Dang, yo, never no more
I'm too tall, above average to ever fall short""
Twenty feet, tall as balconies
We over-stand walls, Rap, 9th and E
No lessons, we learn of the birds and bees
[Verse 2: Erykah Badu & Rapsody]
My love, what did I do
To make you fall so far from me?
And now, I can't recall
The cause of the fall, selective memory
Then you, you built a wall
A twenty-foot wall, so I couldn't see
But if I get off my knees
I might recall I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall

[Chorus: Erykah Badu & Rapsody]
Ooh, hey, I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
Yeah, yeah, I'm twenty feet tall
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall

[Verse 3: Erykah Badu & Rapsody]
My love, what did I do
To make you fall, so far from me?
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
And now, I can't recall
The cause of the fall, selective memory
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall
Then you, you built a wall
A twenty foot wall, so I couldn't see
I realize now I'm twenty feet tall, I realize now I'm twenty feet tall

[Verse 1]
Metropolis had its quieter days
When everyone was behaving
Superman had his lonely times
When no-one needed saving

You can call Captain America
Call Wonder Woman too
Call up any one of them
And sure enough, on cue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They'll fly through sky
They'll jump right out of the sea
But no-one thought to call up
Good old me

[Chorus]
And the only thing that sees me
Through these blues
Is I'm someone's superhero
I just don't know whose
Till then, my lack of powers
You must excuse
'Cause I'm somebody's superhero
Just don't know whose

[Verse 2]
Oh, I ain't got no outfit
To change into at night
No secret power do I hold
No weapon brought to fight

Batman had his Robin
Robin Hood his Merry Men
I got simply nobody
To help me up again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
One day, I'll dive right down on
Speeding train
One day, I'll find myself that
Lois Lane

[Chorus]
And the only thing that sees me
Through these blues
Is I'm someone's superhero
I just don't know whose
Till then, my lack of powers
You must excuse
'Cause I'm somebody's superhero
Just don't know whose

[Bridge]
Heroes and heroines
Untouchable, they are
Pull us free from wreckage
Rescue us from burning car

But not for me, returning heroes'
Cinematic kiss
'Cause I always aim to please
But actually miss

I've no name-check
In the Daily Planet's news
I'm someone's superhero
Just don't know whose

With a fanfare played on
Paper and comb kazoo
I'm somebody's superhero
Just don't know whose
Just don't know whose
Just don't know whose

Som v pohode, nepýtaj sa čo mi je, som v pohode
Dvihni na mne päste, kríč mi do tváre, budem stáť v pohove
Ja nájdem tú silu vždy, ja nájdem tu vôľu žiť
Nič neni nemožné, neni nič čo nemôžem byť
Vravia mi: ""Si iný"", priznávam, že ste za to vinní
Ale nechcem byť rovnaký ako prezentujem paneláky a v nich rodiny
Deti sa nemajú kde hrať a potom a potom nič
Všetko to nechávame na potom
Zameteme pod koberec nech môžeme chodiť naboso, a to je fucked up
Deti vonku fetujú, a to sú faktá
Vyhodené z riadu - ulica aj matka
Nechcú sa určite zlomiť, chcú sa realizovať
No doma je pre známky len ďalšia hádka
Tak utekajú preč lebo majú strach, tak ako ja
V ich veku, rap mi dal silu vety
Hovorili mi, že nebudem nič k svetu, ale

[Verse 2: Samey]
Nosím toho dosť na ramenách
V ruke tašky nech toho toľko mama nemá
A keď toho mala veľa, tak som jej kúpil prsteň - Arabela
Lebo mi záleží, samé otazníky a samé lži
Chceme zase žiť, no čím viac toho máme, sme stratenejší
Niekedy chcem povedať toho toľko, že ostanem len pozerať
A idem po tme tam, tam, kde sa všetka naša láska podela
Myšlienky - píšem ich a potom vyšlem ich tam, kde sú potreba
A moji anjeli - poznám ich po menách
Prídu vždy keď si chcem pokecať
Včera som počúval svoj prvý track
Keby si ho počul tiež
Neveril by si, že sa dostanem až sem
A ty veríš stále svojim snom
Z toho malého semena často vyraste strom
Som živý dôkaz tak ako som

Todos unidos

Pela mesma causa

A busca constante da evolução
E então descobrir verdades da vida

Já descobrimos

Que a união faz a força

A força constante é a mesma fé, que um dia moverá montanhas

Vivendo na manha mas sempre ligado
Quem tá do meu lado, se eu subo, eu levo comigo, é fato
Eu levo comigo é fato, eu levo comigo, levo comigo

A união é sempre forte, e eu sei, levo comigo
A squad sempre forte, a seita é o compromisso

Unidos
$eita fechada fazendo serviço
Só com os demonios esque-matizando o plano e o destino

Se ta perdido aqui é o lugar

Vem para a $eita pra se encontra

Eu e os meus manos
Com u mesmo sonho
Querendo no mesmo destino chegar

Ye ye não paramo não
Nois tamo, é pelaunião
Da uma call lá no Erick no whats
Pra ele fazer toda divulgação

Bem que tu sabe que a $quad é forte
O peso é certeiro, não é sobre sorte
É sobre os passos que damos pro o norte
É sobre como nos rumamos pro norte",0.5531169213354588,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything you don't say or you won't say
It's a cold game and I be sittin' here tryna tell myself
Tell myself that I won't play
Sell my self something that we both ain't
Long nights full of cheap sex and cocaine
Regrets, feeling no pain
And it resets, then we slip
You wake up, you deflect
I'm replaying all these moments dying, tryna redress

Use me, this is free press
Bruise me, what a sweet death
A little more than affliction, this addiction, what a reflex
And these nights getting sleepless
And I eat less but she texting
I'm there with a deep mess
Let me drown all in this regret 'cause

Unvisible barbed wire all along
Around the neck of my song
He Romale, I'm beat up
But going strong

Unstoppable fire of my tongue
And the path ahead that's long
Will get me at the end where I belong

Cause I've seen ship of fools
Sinking in the dunes
As I dragged my coffin on the rope

Them all look down at me
But I got all the help I need
Cause the last one, last one goes the hope
Last one, last one goes the hope

[Spanish?]
Unseizable diamond from my sling
Still is searching for its ring
In a city of ruins where no one sings

But zombies and the willful slaves
Living in their tiny private caves
Crooked hands, digging up their graves

Yeah I've seen ship of fools
Sinking in the dunes
As I dragged my coffin on the rope

Them all look down at me
But I got all the help I need
Cause the last one, last one goes the hope

[Куплет 1: Бледный]
И все по-прежнему аттачат мне свой флаг
А если я не взял его покрепче, тычат фак:
Я слабоумный, лжец, предатель, лицемер
Тут чёрно-белое кино, как у братьев Люмьер
Айсберг плывёт, нам невидим, но понятна картинка
Простодушным детям — папа, смотри, льдинка
А там на глубине в него вцепился Кракен
И кто-то в темноте переставил бакены
Услышь меня, как будто имя моё Симеон
Неправы все, и каждый прав — багряный Расёмон
Запёкся на асфальте крик — тут правды нет
Есть только боль, и эта боль нас ест, мы дети бед
Уйти в Тибет, сбежать в леса и жить в скиту
Но где бы ты ни скрылся, всё равно тебя найдут
И скажут — выбирай, кому сегодня умирать:
Отец, мать, сын, дочь, жена, сестра, брат

[Скит]
Да, это действительно ужасно
Я, наверное, больше никогда не буду верить в людей
[Куплет 2: Бледный]
Мне человеком стыдно быть — любой страны
Я волком стать хочу, чтоб не испытывать вины
И не вступать с вами в споры никогда больше
Ведь этот диалог так похож на скотоложство
А скот нужно просто резать, пока он без сил
Ответь мне, Господи, нас ещё можно спасти?
Составляют списки, кричат — победа близко
Составляют списки тех, кто составляет списки
Но не обманывай себя, ты тоже любишь кровь
Своих врагов, конечно, ни каких-то там коров
Давно просрочен гуманизм на складе светлых лиц
Дофаминовые лайки — пшено для птиц
Мысленные волки на охоте стаями
А все так ждали весну, но не растаяли
Мы под ногами лёд, и в наших душах лёд
Ну что ж, давай, решай, кто сегодня умрёт

[Припев: Ант]
Земля устала нас с тобой нести сквозь звёзд поля
Как нам тут дальше жить, чтоб живы были ты и я
Ведь солнце светит всем на свете
Но этот мир не любит мир
Земля устала нас с тобой нести сквозь звёзд поля
Как нам тут дальше жить, чтоб живы были ты и я
Ведь солнце светит всем на свете
Но этот мир не любит мир

Только не читай мне проповеди
Я не против послушать интересную историю, пока дождь не кончится
Но лучше я буду слушать дождь, чем скучную проповедь

Navy Seals vs Army Rangers Epic Rap Battle,rap,MBest11x,257.0,"[Verse 1: Navy Seal]
Sick with the rap when I bring my flow
I'm spittin' faster than your girl gettin' off with my photo
And every girl dyin' just to give me hugs
Soon as I step out of my motherfuckin' class, BUDS
Top Secret missions you know we never stoppin'
Walk in the bar yellin' ""Bro I just killed Bin Laden!""
Published my book and I got movies made
Next step is rappin' and I'm here to stay

[Verse 2: Army Ranger]
So lets start, and this might be mean
But you can't act (Of valor)
Not even better than Charlie Sheen
I see you on Fox News talkin' about danger
What happened to quiet professional? Oh, that's a Ranger
RASP and Ranger School, stayed up for days and nights
Just to get to regiment to slaughter you on this mic
You belong in a boat, get your ass back in the bay
I know you need a hero so Rangers Lead The Way
I'm a predator, a warrior, and a night stalker
You better EXFIL now like ""Get to the choppa!""
Get all your boys together and I'll call you semen
See that's the same thing that your chick is fiendin'
[Verse 3: Navy Seal]
Sea, air, and land, I've got years of trainin'
I ball so hard they call me Peyton Manning
I got my perfect push-up and my TRX Band
Drinkin' Frog Fuel, ""Why?"" Because I'm the motherfuckin' man
Operator as fuck, hashtag my nation
Dick so big it needs its own station
You think you're operators but half of you can't even grow beards
Climb down your ladder bitch, bottom tier
I got my SWCC, drivin' my whip
Doin' donuts while I'm fightin' Rangerettes off my dick (Hey)
Come to BUDS and we'll make you a believer
But for now quit rap and stick to airfield seizures
You think you're pretty cool with your static line?
How many slots you get to HALO? That's right, get in line
Department of the Navy bitch, you know who
I get more fundin' than your regiment, NSW

[Verse 4: Army Ranger]
Your tier line, it doesn't even work, so let me explain to you
You play with a surfboard, you're not in DEVGRU
Call me Chuck Norris 'cause I'll kill you with my stare
Your pre-mission checks are hands eyes ears (Hair)
We were smokin' dudes before you ever came around
You think makin' movies is original bitch? Black Hawk Down
Your ego is so big I can see it from space
I bet the only picture you masturbate to is to your own face
You joined the Navy, your life is filled with remorse
Just like your girlfriend, after she slept with all of Task Force
You think you spittin' so fast?
It's like the second I rap you come in last
Initiate a blast, screw a failure drill
I'm fuckin' decapitatin' your ass
Because I got it and I'm never gonna stop it
I rip it, kill it, conceal it, steal it, reveal it
Boom to your chest, you know I know you feel it
And after this rap I'm goin' to out shoot you at the range
And give Ranger Panties to your team buddy who just had a sex change",0.27429579198360443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

De elsker at bedøm andre, som om at de er tusind gange bedre
Snakker om hvor mange af de para de laver, jeg sværger
Jeg så bare ikke en tus nogle steder
Så ikke snak om du ruller forbi, laver bang
Jeg sværger, jeg sværger du bange
Sværger jeg ærgrer mig over, i alle bare så hurtigt kræver rav
Tænker tanker ti-titusind gange før jeg gør
Sænker ikke farten, please bliv lige hvor du er
Det er os som er chaufførerne, holder det kørende
Sammen med mine drenge så bare hold dig for ørerne
Altid vær på når det kommer til stykket
Om det så ikke er køkkenet, så ta'r jeg min bid
Klarer jeg min tid, eller forsøger det
Ved siden af pengene, tiden er flyvene
Så kender du perkeren, der altid bedøvende
Men aldrig vær tøvende
Hænger med dem, der er de skøreste
Holder den hundrede mine, gutter vi kører den
Slutter minutterne i smug når vi styrer det
Umuligt at styrte

[Sofia Ges.]

О, нет
Вы к этому не готовы
Нет-нет-нет

Слава разгоняет BPM, как будто митинг в Праге
Едет пробки обгоняя зови его Майкл Наке

Слава на бите гоняет в новом кадиллаке
Едет быстро он на хайпе
Раздавил тебя на танке
Ты смотри по сторонам, когда славяныч выезжает
Он, как жирная мамаша, под 140 набирает
И читает под спидами, обгоняя всех врагов
Slava Merlow гонит быстро, но не может взять венок (Славин)
Зажал Shift и разогнался
Быть последним отказался
Словно Венедикт набрался
В топ спидрана оказался
Раз, два, три, четыре
Слава едет по России
Пять, шесть, семь, восемь
Мы тебя в машину бросим

Раз, два, три, четыре
Слава едет по России
Пять, шесть, семь, восемь
И тебя мы в лес подбросим

Слава на бите играет в шашки будто бы гроссмейстер
Своей бандой может управлять как лучший капельмейстер

Слава выезжает только в тачках больше ляма
Накопилось у него таких на два огромных автопарка
Твоя читка словно Метр, Слава - Молния Максим
Мигом мчится по району, как в майнкрафте Дрим (у)
Разгон твоей материнки
Слава выпустил пластинки
Коп расматривает снимки
Слава курит только стики
Выпуская столько пара, что затмил весь автодром
Если Славе будет надо, твой воспламенится дом (Пау)

[PYL3MY0T]
Проснувшись утром рано, Слава открыл дневничок и затянул косячок

Залетаю на бит будто я динамит
Гоню по Праге будто я болид
У меня есть бабки, зовите меня дед
Потому что я купил себе новый драндулет
Про меня все говорят: ""Это он, это он взломал всех и сделал это через питон"" (о)
Залетаю с двух ног как Михаил Романов
Унижаю, подрываю всех долбанных бояров
Это я оформил себе GoStudy
После этого сделай мне Go Go Suck It (а)
Зарашил Бундестаг, оказался Рейхстаг
Потому что это был очень жесткийй фраг
Потому что так so  hard
Жесткий будто кибертрак

Вот вот вот так

Оформляю вкид
Поджигаю крипера под бит
Go back to home
Go back to hoe
Если Чехия-футбол
То я Реал Мадрид
Залетаю на бит будто паскаль бомбит
Я непобедим, я настоящий Dream
Этот бит ок, куплю себе биток (о)
Захожу в игру

Geechi Gotti vs. K Philosophy,rap,AHAT Battle League,194.0,"[Round 1: K Philosophy]
Some bitch had said he'll slap my granny...
Geechi!?
The guy that shoots people to hide people, and hides people to shoot people?
He must be playin', man...
I'll slap the knowledge out your son, and leave his noggin wit' a lump...I kid (k)not!
Make him watch as I swing the bat at his bitch pops
Your shins pop
Both you fibula and your tibia each broken in six spots
So Gotti limpin' on crutches...waitin' for the 6-6 to heel, and now he can't Crip-walk!
I catch you rollin' wit' the new Black Panther, a.k.a. Big Dot
Fire shit off...'til your ribs ripped off
After the whistle, Gotti leakin'...peanut butter insides: it was a big shot!
Hold up, wait...
Later, we'll get into the Miseducation of Geechi Gotti
For now, I say this bitch ain't right
You must be hiding somethin'
See, I could go on and on...& On...
'Bout how you gave the window seat to the other side of the game, but now yo' time is done
And if you payin' close attention, then right now you know
It's either the Lauryn Hill or the Erykah Badu, and I'm not decidin' one
'Cause whether I choose this thing or That Thing...you gettin' Doo-Wop'd by my Mama's Gun!
I said, try to run
Best not stutter when you step
Gunnin' for your chest
Gotti was just countin' presidents, campaignin' for Champion of the Year
Now you runnin' for your death!
Fuck it...I'd rather hit him wit' the rusty knife instead
The one wit' the fuzzy handle, so he don't remember it quite right when I cut upside his head
It looked like one blade goin' up, two blades comin' down
He don't know if it's the Mandela or the Butterfly Effect!
Now let me get to what I came here to do
I ain't playin' to lose
Only reason people can't win against Gotti? (What's that?)
They try to be more gangsta than you
See, I know there's more to being a man
It's about takin' the leaves off the money trees, plantin' seeds
You know, feedin' the land
Teachin' the youth not to put the hope in steel
But to instill hope they could own a piece of the map
Decrease the probability they'd become a statistic
And increase the chance their degree is in math
See, I got nothin' to say about your eyes bein' shut, Gotti, but look at me when I rap
See, Gotti would rather get a shoddy Ferragamo belt, than help his neighbors get right
I'm sayin' you could actually be making a difference...but you wastin' yo' light
Every time you rap, it's all about the past, and I'm not sayin' it's strife
'Cause we want that authentic Gotti, the one bangin' with stripes
But we also wanna know about the moves that you makin' to start changin' ya life!
We all heard, 100 and a half times 'bout how you big ballin'
Well, we wanna hear about the type of account you settin' up for your kids' college
We all got faith you got that rainy-day stash for when you doin' your bids
What we wanna have faith in is that you'll invest in the future of the community and get some computers for the kids!
See, those are the type of movements Gotti gotta give for
He wanna ask God for forgiveness
See, you happy wit' your name on a SMACK card...
They probably put your name on a building, you get scholarships for the children
And help them overcome the gap in the privilege
The path could be lit to become a mathematician or study graduate physics
Find their passion and be driven for computer programming, and there's a lotta cash in that business
I mean, come on, dawg...it's not like the couple hundred dollars in a laptop's expensive
What is stopping you from givin' back to these kids and providin' them with tools to start hackin' the system!?
'Cause it's not like you don't got resources
Cali Smoov be givin' back, B. Dot got an LLC
I'm sure they're down to give you some tips, G
And maybe when you prove you can think outside of the box society put you in, you can finally get a track done wit' Nipsey!
I said, the rules ain't change since the game start
I run circles 'round these rappers just to play darts
And y'all don't faze me - I beat the battle wit' my inner demons
And you can't know every bar 'til you learn to read between 'em
Game Code!
[Round 1: Geechi Gotti]
This nigga said buy computers and shit for the school...
That was some shit that you fed us, and all these people ate it
So the people can ""hack the system""...the ones that yo' people created?
Nigga, you'se a bitch!
They only brought me here so they could see me G-check you on some Loc shit
Y'all know the nigga that's always wettin' the blunt and never puttin' in on the weed?
I'm the nigga you don't want smoke wit'
Bro, quit, you don't wanna fight
It'll be Jada and Will: I'mma swing a (swinger) couple
Ya knees'll buckle, the Nina slump you
Stand over the body, you know it's goin' up
Deuce in his face: how many fingers I'm holdin' up?
You voted Trump!? I should kill you for that reason!
The choppa wit' me
I've been spendin' mo' time wit' the big bitch: it's tax season!
The MAC squeezin', I'm sittin' him down
He probably got a gun, but can't shoot it
He really a clown
I see K tryna raise his stock, so fuck it, I'mma give him a round - BLAOW!
Nigga, you'se a teacher?
I'll go to yo' classroom and say, ""Fuck yo' lesson!""
It's ten of y'all? Get this cap fired, and sat nine (SAT-9) like, ""Bruh, we testin'!""
Why would you wanna test me!?
Crazy is what you gotta be
Nigga, I'm a boss, I really paid the cost to be
Cross my line, and y'all gon' see White smacked (Smack) like Flossafee
Yeah, you got bars, but you a no-name, honestly
It's crazy you the teacher, but I'm the reason the world finna learn about Philosophy
Nigga, I'm a G
When I shoot, it's hard to keep the K still
I'll let the K peel
What it's like to die gon' be the only thing K feel (Phil')
Scratch that - empty pine box, I'mma let K fill
This a nasty tre (tray): State meal
They gon' blame me when you get bodied...Jae Millz!
Aye, Phil...
Wait, yo' name is Matt K-
FUCK yo' last name! I can't pronounce that shit
I keep somethin' beefy on me
Headshot - now they callin' Matt dead to make it easy on me
Believe me, homie
You came in with me, so seein' the way I rise, I know you don't like it
Sick is what you gotta be
'Cause we came in this shit together, but I was just a straight-A student the way I passed Philosophy
This white boy got soul, though, for real!
It's like you kinda black 'cause you be rappin' wit' us
Prob'ly eat cornbread and gumbo
Be mad at the cops for all the slack they give us
I'm lookin' at him, though, but this nigga really white...but you black…
But just like him...I'll crack a (cracker) nigga!
Boom-brrap a nigga!
See a round come off the top: he free-stylin'
Face shot
They like, ""Gotti, why you got the cannon (Canon) flashin' on him?""
This nigga keep smilin'!
We wildin' for respect!
My niggas'll die 'bout that
Hey, if you catch me outside, you gon' need a doctor (Dr.), Phil': how 'bout that!?
'Cause I got straps, .40s, .9s, ARs and such
I'll put big arms on this lil' nigga...the code word was ""Clutch""!
What's up wit' this Harry Potter-lookin' mu'fucka, man!?
Actin' like he never seen a Crip before
I'll show up to his crib wit' the Sweepers like Quidditch, ask him, ""What it's hittin' for?""
Catch him lackin' in his mu'fuckin' whip, then give him four
I even let a few shells slither in (Slytherin) Gryffin door (Gryffindor)!
Nigga, this is war!
I'll pull up to ya classroom, pull the weapon out
Stretch him out - BLAOW!
Now Phil' (feel) on the kids like a pedophile, nigga!
Settle down!
I'll let it ring on Matt - BAH! BAH!
Now I got a can' but no mo' shells...black people never got two things that match
I'll beat yo' ass, white boy!
I dare you to get violent
I'm from Nutty Blocc
Disrespect that, and all night, nigga, the Crips ridin'
This nigga scared straight - look at him
But y'all shoulda knew if you put a K in front of an N, it gets silent
Nigga, this The Riot!
But I'm still the highest-viewed mothafucka on Shots Fired!
Niggas go all the way to San Diego just to see the big dog black: I'm a Rottweiler
When shots fired in the hood, it's mando' that we shoot back
Nigga, but yo' crew wack
Gotti keep two straps, so it ain't nothin' to get a Wave capped on stage like Mook back
True facts, nigga, my mind different
Tre-five-seven - I'll put the nose on white like I'm line-sniffin'
The .9 spittin'
We had high hopes for you!
We thought you would be one of the ones to translate to the masses
But instead it's crazy this nigga a professor, but every time we gave him a test he couldn't pass it
Nigga Pop, you got ya ass kicked
Clutch, you got ya ass kicked
Griz, Ron, Spot, you gave us some classics but...you got ya ass kicked
Look, I'm not the nigga to play wit'
Boy I'm grown, you a lil' nigga
I'll throw this two piece 'cross the ring like Razor Ramon
You don't know that I'm on?
You sweet as cupcake
This nigga sweet as a cupcake
I got the gauge wit' me, it's a 10 shot, but I'm a just bust 8
Code word ""Hand down/man down""
(What the fuck that mean?)
You got shot in the face for thinkin' the pump fake
For fuck sake
Look man, sucka shit, just know Gotti don't condone that
I already own straps
I'll catch you in front of ya mama house
Headshot, he laid out in front of the do', welcome home Matt (mat)
Our lifestyles is real different, just know there's no comparin' it
When I talk that gang shit, I'm not glorifyin', I'm just acknowledgin'
See I ain't gotta be sharin' it
Most of my niggas either dead or in jail
So if they don't make it to a cell, them niggas goin' underground like they followin' Harriet
I coulda took it light on K, but when it's real
BAOW! Can't even see the eyes on K
And when it's real, y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes

Y,rap,Nick Trees,23.0,"Verse:

I lay down hopin’ for an easy death fallin’ asleep and never waking up
Trapped with the worst thoughts in a dark room but I’m never giving up
Fed up when I feel like I gotta walk around with a fake smile, Y is my chromosome
I hate that my mom can’t retire instead she’s indebted to a student loan
Now I gotta wake up, get the cake up, I can feel it gravitatin’
Hope at the end of the rope and the truth is I’m running out of patience
Maybe it’ll change for the better but I know better not to hold my breath waitin’
I lay down hopin’ for an easy life fallin’ asleep and now I need to wake up
Why?

Chorus:

We’re losing people every day because of madness
We’re losing people every day because of sadness
We’re losing people like it doesn’t even matter
You got me questioning why?
Fess up!
[Repeat]
Verse 2:

Gusher
I am your luster
Why are you acting so flustered?
Do not run away I am here to help
But how can I help you if I don’t help myself?
Do not be afraid I am just like you?
I feel like my time is coming overdue
Manifest the good, make me blush
Anger fuels the veins, now I’m flush
Remember the days that I felt like the worst
Feelin’ embodied encountered the hearse
Pray for the better it never shows
Why do I give up before results?
Blame everybody but me in the mirror
I am the problem it brings me to tears
Maybe I’m not but I’m trying my best
Love for myself with the greatest respect

Chorus:

We’re losing people every day because of madness
We’re losing people every day because of sadness
We’re losing people like it doesn’t even matter
You got me questioning why?
Fess up!

No Celebrations,rock,OSI,321.0,"You're frightened by the memories
You're frightened by your greed
You're frightened of the silent rooms

You see murder in disguise

You're frightened by the things they say

Peter Fox - Schwarz zu Blau,rap,Genius English Translations,253.0,"Come out of the club, it's been good
Stink of booze, I'm knackered, it's a good life
Step over schnapps corpses that pollute my way
I see the rats eating themselves fat in the shadow of the kebab shop
Stamp through the vomit at Kotti, junkies are pissed
Mates snort around me, make themselves comfortable
Scene-hipsters on a troubled search for the scene
Pierced girls who want me to read ""Straßenfеger""
Half five, my eyеs burn
Step on a guy sleeping between two dead pigeons
Hysterical girls bicker and panic and then
On the corner there's stress between Tarek and Sam
Tarek says ""Shut your mouth or I'll punch you in the face""
Sam shits himself, but he can't say nothing
Red soup drips on the asphalt
I feel sick, I zip up my jacket because it's cold

Good morning Berlin
You can be so ugly, so dirty and grey
You can be so beautifully terrible
Your nights eat me up
It would probably be best for me
I go home and get some sleep
And as I walk through the street
It slowly turns from black to blue
[Bridge]
Tired forms in neon lights
With deep creases in their faces
The early shift stays silent, everyone keeps to themselves
Frustration comes, because the bus doesn't come

And there's shit everywhere, really you have to float
Everyone has a dog, but no-one to talk to
I constantly breathe through my mouth, it's part of my life
I feel unhealthy, need something pure to treat it
I have a thick head, I need juice
I have a powerful yearning for ""Baghdad's Bakery""
It's warm there, I devote myself to my dreams
With Fatima, the sweet baker
R'n'B ballads pump from a parked Benz
Work's over for the street gangs
A hooligan lies in a woman's arms and weeps
The city isn't as hard as you think

[Hook]
Good morning Berlin
You can be so ugly, so dirty and grey

I'm knackered, rub your dust
Out of my eyes

Your panorama fucks up
You don't look beautiful from far away
But the sun goes straight up

That I need you in order to breathe",0.4027712590371569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We mix our country with some hip hop beats

The Faceless Boy,rock,Ezra Furman & The Harpoons,643.0,"The boy who was born without a face
Can't go out in public or any place
He just sits at home and he cries all day
Or he would if his tears had a way to escape
No eyes, no mouth
His north is your south

His parents wonder what went wrong
Did we start too early did we wait too long
Or is it all a part of God's peculiar maze
That our baby was born without a face
Look out! Cuz you can...

Well, the faceless boy's life, well, it ain't too grim
Cuz he got no ears to hear them laugh at him
Still when guests come over they keep the lights dim
And the sign on his bedroom says: Don't come in

In the faceless boy's mind the pine trees grow
They're evergreens they last through the winter snow
But he can't smell which way the wind blows
Cuz no face, no eyes, no ears, no mouth, no nose! No nose!
The girl who was born without any hands
All she does is dance and dance
Can't pick up a pen, can't put on her pants
All she does is dance cuz it's all she can oo!

Ain't got no fingers ain't got no thumbs
And she could never fight it so she succumbs
To fate on the date on which she was born
She thinks of herself as a unicorn alright

She wanders around all over the land
Looking around for her handless man
But she just ends up collapsing in the sand
In her mind, no hands, no hands, no hands, no hands! No hands, oh!

When the faceless boy met the handless girl
All the cosmos above them swirled
He felt her face, she stared at his hand
And they walked on and never saw each other again. Oh no!
Faceless boy! Faceless boy oh!",0.15745524247176945,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gangsta's Paradise,,Coolio Featuring L.V.,,"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight

They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is goin', I don't know

Tell me, why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark

Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to

You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago

'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too

Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

Wake Me Up!,,Avicii,,"[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over

You look like my next mistake

Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

And you love the game

Cherry lips, crystal skies

Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

Say You Won't Let Go,,James Arthur,,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I'll forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you, and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind

Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?

Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside, but they still lied

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm takin' off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mil', hell if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Huh, who you think they talk about? Talk about us (You outta pocket; shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt) Copy off us (Get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh, you ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah), you steppin' or what? (You outta pocket)

Ventin' in the sa—

Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attractin' the feds when I'm brackin', look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Hold up, hold up)
Let's think about this for a second (Let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (Let's go)

Would you sell your bro for leverage? (

Story Of My Life,,One Direction,,"[Verse 1: Harry & Liam]
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

[Chorus: All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
[Verse 2: Niall &  Liam]
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

Is when I'm alone with you

To keep the goddess on my side

For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night


Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'

Hold on

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

Pinagtagpo talaga tayo’t pinana ni kupido
Sa kabaitan mong taglay lalo kita na ginusto, grabe ka den mag alaga kasi yan ang tipo
Wag kang mag a-alala susuklian ko yan lahat, sayo palang kasi ay kuntento na ako’t sapat

Nalulungkot ako kapag hindi ka na kasama, namimiss kita palagi pag hindi ka nakikita

Tao lang naman kasi tayo at nagkakamali
Di maiwasan ang mali kahit alam nangang mali
Kaya patawad na mahal sa mga nagawang mali, hayaan mo akong muli at sayo na makabawi
Papa-alala ko sayo kung pano ka sumasaya, nuong nag sisimula palang nun tayong dalawa
Nag haharutan sa daan at magka hawak ang kamay, grabe kapa nun tumawa ang lakas mong mag ingay

She Had Me At Heads Carolina,,Cole Swindell,,"(Heads Carolina, tails California)

Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream

You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Watching you's the only drug I need

You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me

I wanna kiss you like Prince

Keep it real to real in the way I feel

When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazin', 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)

No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone

Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)

Not Afraid,,Eminem,,"[Chorus/Collision]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

Whatever It Takes,,Imagine Dragons,,"[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip

Break me down and build me up

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

""" You Shook Me All Night Long """,,AC/DC,,"[Verse 1]
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

[Verse 2]
Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it
[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

You shook me all night long

Don't ask me, I'll never tell

Set Fire To The Rain,,Adele,,"[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]

Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

[Breakdown]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention

To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more

Open up your plans and, damn, you're free

We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be
Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

Forever After All,,Luke Combs,,"[Verse 1]
A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

Numb Little Bug,,Em Beihold,,"[Verse 1]
I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in LA
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

[Chorus]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?
[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

[Verse 2]
The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna see
If this could make me happy

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh out of love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

Heart Attack,,Demi Lovato,,"[Intro]
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
[Verse 2]
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Bridge]
The feelings are lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb (I'd rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
So scared, I take off and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames
[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up

Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too

So Good,,Halsey,,"Lookin' right, lookin' like
All the stars are fated
I remember the night
I was so frustrated
I touch your hand for the first time
I see it on your face, then
Another lifetime's flashin' by

I'm here
Standin' in the same dress
You're in your apartment
I'm already gone

When you left, I bet you held her body closer
And I was hopin' you would tell her it was over
You're all I think about and everywhere I look
I know it's bad, but we could be so good

Couple yеars flashin' by
And I'm doin' okay
In the back of my mind
All I hear is your name
I bеt you're happy and that's fine
But I regret just one thing
I never got to change your mind

I'm here
Standin' in the same dress
You're in your apartment
I'm already gone
Talkin'
Wildly out of context
I wish things were different
But I'll never know

When you left, I bet you held her body closer
And I was hopin' you would tell her it was over
You're all I think about and everywhere I look
I know it's bad, but we could be so good

Maria calls me and she says she's gettin' married
She asked me if there's any extra weight I carry
And do I think about the one that got away
I know his name, I think about him every day

Eye Of The Tiger,,Survivor,,"[Verse 1]
Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all

Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop

""" Love Story """,,Taylor Swift,,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
[Breakdown]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get

Burn It Down,,Linkin Park,,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

Play It Again,,Luke Bryan,,"[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Bridge]
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long

[Video by Dave Jensen and Tavic]

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive

[Chorus]
The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)
[Verse]
Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)

Scars To Your Beautiful,,Alessia Cara,,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart

While I'm wasted with someone else?”

Apenas sale el sol y tú te vas corriendo
Sé que pensarás que esto me está doliendo
Yo no estoy pensando en lo que estás haciendo
Si somos ajenos y así nos queremos (mm-mm-mm)

[Pre-Estribillo]
Si conmigo te quedas, o con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo porque sé que volverás
Si conmigo te quedas, o con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo porque sé que volverás

[Estribillo]
Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz, felices los 4
Te agrandamo' el cuarto
Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz, felices los 4
Yo te acepto el trato

Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Y lo hacemo' otro rato (alright-alright, baby)

[Verso 2]
Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Lo nuestro no depende de un pacto
Disfruta y sólo siente el impacto
El boom boom que te quema, ese cuerpo de sirena
Tranquila que no creo en contratos (y tú menos...)

[Refrán]
Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí, y felices los 4
No importa el qué dirán, nos gusta así

Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí, y felices los 4
No importa el qué dirán, somos tal para cual

Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, ""Stop playin' it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control""

Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

And I could try to run, but it would be useless

How Deep Is Your Love,,Bee Gees,,"[Verse 1]
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus]
How deep is your love?

'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down

We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do
And it's me you need to show

Come on!

[Verse 1]
Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

[Chorus]
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold
[Verse 2]
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

[Chorus]
My blood runs cold (Yeah)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold (Oh yeah)

I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

""" Hello """,,Adele,,"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

Nightmare,,Avenged Sevenfold,,"[Intro]
Nightmare!
Now your nightmare comes to life

[Verse 1]
Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever (Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed (Burn the world your last endeavor)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare

While your nightmare comes to life
[Verse 2]
Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason (Loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Fight (Fight!), not to fail (Fail!), not to fall (Fall!)
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (Die!), die again (Die!), drenched in sin (Sin!)
With no respect for another, oh!
Down (Down!), feel the fire (Fire!), feel the hate (Hate!)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!), hit the wall (Wall!), watch you crawl (Crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul, and it's ours now to steal

As your nightmare comes to life

Baby, I still see ya

Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya

When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you (Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else

I Need A Doctor,,Dr. Dre Featuring Eminem & Skylar Grey,,"I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy, or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man,"" 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time

Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out

But somehow, baby
You broke through and saved me

Thriller,,Michael Jackson,,"[Verse 1]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time
[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
[Chorus]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow!)

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)

The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb

And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)

I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 2]
Some people try but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same
[Chorus]
I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you, you

[Bridge]
Some people pray to their god for some magic
Cause no easy love could ever make them feel the same
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

[Chorus]
I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Outro]

I Won't Give Up,,Jason Mraz,,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love

To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

Some even fall to the earth

God knows we're worth it

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not

[Intro]
Ya yo me cansé, no quiero ser tu amante
Te digo de mi parte, que no aguanto más
Ya no aguanto ver el otro cómo dice que es el dueño tuyo
Me mata el orgullo, él ni te sabe hablar

[Pre-Coro]
Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche, quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé y no me luce
Todo es por usted

Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te siente' mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te siente' fría

[Verso 1]
Solo una cosa te preguntaré
Si tiene' frío, ¿Quién te da calor?
Yo soy el dueño de tus fantasía'
Nadie lo hace como yo
Si te viste' bonita, él no te dice na'
Y a mí, tú me gusta' hasta sin maquillar
Tú siempre a mí me dice' que él te trata mal
Y eso lo tienes que acabar

[Puente]
Dime qué tú vas a hacer
Mami, tengo la inquietud
Si quieres sufrir con él, eso lo decides tú
¿Que serás feliz con él? Yo no te contestaré
Sé que me vas a llamar cuando me extrañe tu piel (Tu piel)

Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence

With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones

They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe

Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement

""" Fernando """,,ABBA,,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I-I-I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

Put on somethin' tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle

Lights,,Ellie Goulding,,"[Verse 1]
I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe
[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong

The Cave,,Mumford & Sons,,"[Verse 1]
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 2]
'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 3]
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

[Chorus 2]
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be
[Chorus/Outro]

Ohh!
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Verse 2]
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather

[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
[Bridge 1]
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again

[Bridge 2]
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again

Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

""" Wind of Change """,,Scorpions,,"[Intro]
(Whistling)

[Verse 1]
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
(Whistling)

[Verse 2]
The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close?
Like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
[Chorus]
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change
(mmmmmmm)

[Verse 3]
Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

[Chorus]
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)

[Bridge]
The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to sing (sing)
[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)

""" Candle in the Wind 1997 """,,Elton John,,"Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

And it seems to me you lived your life

Never fading with the sunset

Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled

And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter

Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what I'm chasing after

To Be Loved By You,,Parker McCollum,,"[Verse 1]
Hell, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Finding out why shouldn't take this long
Easier said than done, I guess
I'm a little bit harder to love than the rest
Why does this have to be so hard?
Doing my best to hold your heart
And I, I'll never let it go again

[Chorus]
So why are you always angry?
Why are you always quiet?
Why do you sleep alone
When I know you don't like it?
Maybe you might be different
Will it kill you to tell me the truth?
What in the Hell does a man
Have to do, to be loved by you?

[Verse 2]
Well I've been running as fast as I can
And you'll never get over what you can't understand
Pissed off, hanging up the telephone
Forever ain't far, I'm heading home
Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Last time you ever gonna find me gone
And I, I'll never let you go again

So why are you always angry?
Why are you always quiet?
Why do you sleep alone
When I know you don't like it?
Maybe you might be different

The Sound Of Silence,,Disturbed,,"[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence
[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence",0.5559195717796683,billboard,billboard.com,hot-100,,2016-06-04,66.0,,2025-11-22T16:43:18.797585+00:00,The Sound of Silence,Disturbed,Immortalized,41.0,248466.0,False,0.322,0.28,6.0,-9.367,0.0,0.0281,0.468,1.1e-06,0.102,0.175,85.794,4.0,alternative,,-1.466412407112717,-1.964159251103512,0.1874885229481329,0.1230176256856558,en,5.818307692307692,0.6022884615384615,0.393534617583591,0.3111161797294077,0.0847448519429523

He said, ""Here comes the big boss, let's get it on""
We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand new trip

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung fu fighting (Huh!)
Those cats were fast as lightning (Ha!)
In fact, it was a little bit frightening (Huh!)
But they did it with expert timing (Ha!)

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
(Oh-ho-ho-ho, ha)
(Oh-ho-ho-ho, ha)
(Oh-ho-ho-ho, ha)
(Oh-ho-ho-ho, ha)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Sure enough

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung fu fighting (Huh!)
Those cats were fast as lightning (Ha!)
In fact, it was a little bit frightening (Huh!)
Make sure you have expert timing (Ha!)
[Outro]

Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain

But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue, and Judas is the demon I cling to

Why? (

Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (
Louder
)

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost, but now I am found
I can see that, once, I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey (

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why

It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud

Calling security, keepin' my head held down

Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter

These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

Emotionally Scarred,,Lil Baby,,"[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah
[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

'Til You Can't,,Cody Johnson,,"You can tell your old man you'll do some large-mouth fishin' another time

You can always put a rain check in his hand

Swearin' that you'll ask someday further down the road

If you got a dream chase it

There's a box of greasy parts sittin' in the trunk of that sixty-five
Still waitin' on you and your grandad to bring it back to life
You can always get around to fixin' up that Pontiac

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

Wagon Wheel,,Darius Rucker,,"[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me

Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?

Happier Than Ever,,Billie Eilish,,"[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
[Chorus]
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)

Knowing You,,Kenny Chesney,,"[Verse 1]
Knowing you, you probably got your toes in the sand
At a bar on a beach in the sun somewhere
Knowing you, you got something cold in your hand
Chatting up a stranger without a care
Knowing you, you're still wild and free
And knowing you, you're probably way over me

[Chorus]
But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

[Verse 2]
Knowing you was a free-fall from a hundred thousand feet
When you don't even care where you land
And knowing you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
And knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

In A Minute,,Lil Baby,,"[Intro]
Damn Kai, you goin' crazy

[Verse 1]
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friends, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bro, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we're the who's who's?
Still run around with mohawk, Jet ready, pack the Goyard
People think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is ""Baby, keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick divided
Bro ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be knowin' the rundown, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come check, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full court press, foot on they neck and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat and tears come with these checks and it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gone get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' playdoh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spend good, I'm on my way to Clayco
AK47s in the spots before they made the Draco
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill, I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill, I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuyin' cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'm gonna pull up and spray that
Livin' like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like yo mama with the switch ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bro taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
[Chorus]

Willow,,Taylor Swift,,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case

The First Noel,,Gabby Barrett,,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That have made heaven and earth of naught
And with His blood mankind hath bought

Rain Is A Good Thing,,Luke Bryan,,"My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, sayin', ""Son, it's way too dry""
It clouds up in the city, the weatherman complains

Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Ain't nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Wringing out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When the tin roof gets to talkin', that's the best love we make

So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way

Body Like A Back Road,,Sam Hunt,,"Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you

Melody that you hear and you can't forget

Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else

Tryna make it disappear

There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be

Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

I gave you everything, what's mine is yours

But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt

Singles You Up,,Jordan Davis,,"[Verse 1]
I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

[Verse 2]
He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in (Walked in)
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along (Singing along)
And he don't even know a single word

God's Country,,Blake Shelton,,"Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around

We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again

All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile
[Verse 3]
I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

After A Few,,Travis Denning,,"I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking

A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do

Little touch, little reminisce

Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close

I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)

You did some things that you regret, still ride for you

Buy Dirt,,Jordan Davis Featuring Luke Bryan,,"Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around

Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less than she needs

Unaware I'm tearing you asunder

You
You and me, won't be unhappy

Be running up that hill
Be running up that building

Come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling

Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon

A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

Why you always in a mood?

So why you tryna feign your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talkin' slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter
, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire
, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (
Monster
)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
Here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable

Sturdiana, buss a move when I get up behind ya

I do what I do and she do what she wanna
That's a fact and no cap
Me and Sheff had to run up them racks
If you miss then we doublin' back

Fell in love and I got too attached

Is you with it?, If you up it, I up it, let's get it
Sleepy ain't feel no love in a minute

Fall back, baby I gotta breathe
Fear nobody, I'm ready to bleed
And she for the streets, she not for me
From a place where they never believe
In the hood, thought I never would leave
Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knock as he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive
You seen what I seen then you'd probably agree
Cops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief
And mama told me not to play in these streets
It's too late 'cause l'm playin' for keeps

And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So, baby, I can make it right
You just gotta let me try (Try)
To give you what you want

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through

[Verse 1: Kruddz]
Came from the bottom, had to stack my pence
Never goin' broke, that's common sense
With bro, bring a ratchet friend
Rollin' with smoke, just in case of nonsense
In this life they'd rather see me down, oh
That's why I wake up, thank God, oh
Look around, many rivals
Have to bun man's flesh for survival

[Verse 2: Mojo]
Who's that +234? That's my Naij babe
Never seen you before, how you my mate?
I can't even trust myself in this climate
Animal instincts, no primate
Cuttin' through Euston, doing what I'm used to
Packs flyin' like a rocket from Houston
I can't love you the way that I used to
You know what? I better go get a new you
[Chorus: OGD]
Shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Shake, shake, shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party

[Verse 3: Dope]
If it ain't money, then why you in my mentions?
No, I don't want no lames in my section
What I'm in ain't a rental
That's why she had her eyes on me when she entered
Having brekkie for dinner, how could I give you advice?
You can probably snake me once, but you can't do it twice
Yeah, I made it and I said I always will like Mike
Yeah, I made it and I said I always will like Mike

[Verse 4: Papii Abz]
I put the fashion in fashionably late
Been puttin' work and nothin' ain't changed
Power in me from my ancestry
Got me seein' things I could never have seen
Don't just do this for elómì
Do it for the squad, family
Don't pretend you're a friend with me
Vibes tell me you're an enemy

Shake it, baby, don't break it

Ah, ah
I'm so highly blessed
Me go broke? I highly doubt it
Big ol' back, but you can't even shake it
They got gun, but they can't even shoot it, ah, ah
This one no be S.I, this one na bling-bling
She dey feel me the way I dey sing sing
Show me real love, don't show me fake ting
From this side, life no be joke ting

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verso 1]
Una lágrima que cae, una sensación que hay que disimular
Porque aunque lo sé, lo sabes
Nunca fui capaz de hablar
Yo sé que fuiste tú, el que te fuiste tú
Y si Madrid se quedó solo, eso lo hiciste tú
Y no me importa si vas a llamarme
Yo quiero besarte, besarte y besarte (Besarte), ey

[Coro]
No sé que pasará en Berlín, si esto va a ser el fin
Pero me jode más tener que esperarte
¿Qué pasará en Berlín si tú no estás aquí?
Tal vez si vuelves, no seré la de antes
Yo sé que fuiste tú, el que te fuiste tú
Y si Madrid se quedó solo, eso lo hiciste tú
Y no me importa si vas a llamarme
Yo quiero besarte, besarte y besarte (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
[Refrán]
Besarte y besarte y ahora me jode más tener que esperarte
Besarte y besarte y ahora me jode más tener que olvidarte

[Verso 2]
Dije que amor de lejos, felices los cuatro
Si estás con alguien pienso a cada rato
Y no son celos, ponte en mis zapatos
¿Cómo nos damos besos por un iPhone?
No, sé que no, servirá de nada y lo siento yo
Si te vas a ir, vete, por favor
Que tanta espera está peor

[Coro]
No sé que pasará en Berlín, si esto va a ser el fin (Si esto va a ser el fin)
Pero me jode más tener que esperarte
¿Qué pasará en Berlín si tú no estás aquí? (Si tú no estás aquí)
Tal vez si vuelves, no seré la de antes
Yo sé que fuiste tú, el que te fuiste tú
Y si Madrid se quedó solo, eso lo hiciste tú
Y no me importa si vas a llamarme
Yo quiero besarte, besarte y besarte (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Tujhe Kitna Chahne Lage,,Arijit Singh,,"[Verse 1]

I ain't never had a girl like this, real to the core, it's real
And I can't talk 'bout sex every day on the track
So I talk 'bout the shit I feel
I might give you flowers and kisses, not just dick, and this shit's real
I might pull up on a late-night one
Like slap on a movie and come, let's chill
I remember the day that I met you, no way could I evеr forget that
I would go back home in the DLR train, just missin' thе fact you left, man
I'm textin' bro like, ""Yo""
E man text me back like, ""Wah gwan?""
I said, ""Bro, after all the hoe stages I'm ready, I found the one""
Fake accounts gonna talk their shit, why? Both of us be lit
And I don't really give a fuck 'bout that, as long as our relationship is bliss
And I know that my baby humble, but I know that your temper's short
And I know that I hurt you one time, if I do that again then I'm a fool
And I know that the love runs deep, trust me, you know I know
And I know that you really do got me, trust me, I know, I know
Wintertime is cold, it's cold, and I find it hard to express
So I'm writin' this shit on notes, I just put my feelings into the music

Got the old school love like '90s
And god forbid, if I ever go jail, then I know that my babe will write me
And I know that its ya b-day soon, I got you and you on your b-day, boo
I know when you're upset, trust me, man I see straight through

Better days are comin', if no one told you
I hate to hear you cryin', over the phone, dear
For seven years runnin', you've been a soldier

[Pre-Chorus]
But better days are comin'
Better days are comin' for you (Mm-hmm)
So when the night feels like forever (Mm-hmm)
I'll remember what you said to me

I know you've been hurtin'
Waitin' on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent
And soon we'll be dancin' in the sun
We'll be dancin' in the sun
And we'll sing your song togеther (Hey-hey, hеy-hey, hey, hey-hey)
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)

[Verse 2]
We never miss the flowers until the sun's down
You never count the hours until they're runnin' out
You're on the other side of the storm now, you should be so proud
[Pre-Chorus]
Better days are comin'
Better days are comin' for you (Mm-hmm)
So when the night feels like forever (Mm-hmm)
I'll remember what you said to me

[Chorus]
I know you've been hurtin' (Is our time ever soothin'?)
Waitin' on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent (Is our time ever soothin'?)
And soon we'll be dancin' in the sun
We'll be dancin' in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)

La vie qu'on mène,,Ninho,,"Chady
Hey, hey

Bientôt, j'irai au ciel rejoindre Rimkus, le p'tit Lamine
Regarde la vie qu'on mène, on fait ça que pour la famille
On a toujours fait que du sale et nos parents ne font que prier
Pardonne-moi si j'suis pas là, c'est qu'je cours derrière les milliers
J'suis avec Savastano dans un quatre étoiles en Crête
Pas très loin de Malia, elle est chargée sous le maillot
Le nez dans mes affaires, bébé, m'attends pas pour le dîner
Et si c'est trop bizarre, bah, j'disparaîtrais comme Houdini
Vaillant comme Souleymane, vaillant comme Mekness et di-Meh
À deux doigts d'péter l'million, mais ce pédé s'fait désirer
Pour l'instant, j'suis dans le hall, sous doré, j'réfléchis
Qui aura l'sourire en coin d'bouche si je flanche ?
Ceux qui parlent fort sont que des baltringues déguisées
J'ai les chaussures qui piquent, j'arrive vers les Champs-Élysées
On peut t'enlever la vie pour sauver nos réputations
Évitons toutes les tentations, à l'heure qu'il est, j'suis dans l'avion
On tire, laisse-les planter, j'arrive en tête du peloton, j'suis là que pour la plata (J'suis là que pour la plata)
Le lundi et le mardi, le gérant se lève à cinq heures par peur qu'on vienne l'éclater (Par peur qu’on vienne l'éclater)

Y a rien d'facile dans l'argent facile, Zé Pequeno me fascine
.357 Magnum, pas de grappling
Y a la volaille qui rapplique, on s'échappe
Minuit, pété sous champ', demain, j's'rai aux Seychelles
Et pour avoir cette vie-là, j'ai remonté les bretelles
Quand le rêve est trop long, le réveil est brutal
Black Panther, comme la daronne de 2Pac
Les barreaux ou les tropiques, on prendra l'argent d'tout-par
Et de toute façon, c'est nous les bests, en vrai
Dis-leur qu'ils restent tranquilles ou le machin va discuter
Tu veux donner des coups de mains ? Allez, baise ton père
J'ai mon papier, j’ai mon équipe, j'suis pas dans la mendicité

Élève dissipé d’après les dires du prof'
Cinq ans plus tard, son fils me demandera une to-ph'
Cinq-cents milles albums plus tard, ma tête a pas gonflé
Le prochain s’appellera ""Destin"", j'vais tout vous raconter (Et j'dirai que la vérité)

Bientôt, j'irai au ciel rejoindre Rimkus, le p'tit Lamine
Regarde la vie qu'on mène, on fait ça que pour la famille
On a toujours fait que du sale et nos parents ne font que prier

[Intro: All]
Lovesick girls
Lovesick girls

[Verse 1: Jennie, All]
영원한 밤
창문 없는 방에 우릴 가둔 love (Love)
What can we say?
매번 아파도 외치는 love (Love)

[Verse 2: Lisa]
다치고 망가져도 나
뭘 믿고 버티는 거야
어차피 떠나면 상처투성인
채로 미워하게 될걸
끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어
이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo, Rosé]
아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
But I don't care, I'll do it over and over
내 세상 속엔 너만 있으면 돼
[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Post-Chorus: All]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

[Verse 3: Lisa, Jennie]
No love letters, no X and O's
No love, never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone
Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo]
아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
불안한 내 눈빛 속에 널 담아
아프더라도 너만 있으면 돼
[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Post-Chorus: All]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

[Bridge: Rosé, Jisoo]
사랑은 slippin' and fallin'
사랑은 killin' your darlin'
아프다 아물면 또 찾아오는 이 겁 없는 떨림
들리지 않아 what you say
이 아픔이 난 행복해
나를 불쌍해 하는 네가 내 눈엔 더 불쌍해

[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

過ぎる日々にあくびが出る
さんざめく夜越え今日も
渋谷の街に朝が降る
どこか虚しいような
そんな気持ち つまらないな
でもそれでいい そんなもんさ これでいい

知らず知らず隠してた
本当の声を響かせてよほら
見ないフリしていても
確かにそこにある

嗚呼 感じたままに描く
自分で選んだその色で
眠い空気纏う朝に
訪れた青い世界
好きなものを好きだと言う
怖くて仕方ないけど
本当の自分 出会えた気がしたんだ

嗚呼 手を伸ばせば伸ばすほどに
遠くへゆく 思うようにいかない今日も
また慌ただしくもがいてる
悔しい気持ちも ただ情けなくて
涙が出る 踏み込むほど
苦しくなる 痛くもなる

嗚呼 感じたままに進む
自分で選んだこの道を
重いまぶた擦る夜に
しがみついた青い誓い
好きなことを続けること
それは楽しいだけじゃない
本当にできる 不安になるけど

嗚呼 何枚でも ほら何枚でも
自信がないから描いてきたんだよ
嗚呼 何回でも ほら何回でも
積み上げてきたことが武器になる
周りを見たって 誰と比べたって
僕にしかできないことはなんだ
今でも自信なんかない それでも

感じたことない気持ち
知らずにいた想い あの日踏み出して
初めて感じたこの痛みも全部
好きなものと向き合うことで
触れたまだ小さな光
大丈夫行こうあとは楽しむだけだ

嗚呼 全てを賭けて描く
自分にしか出せない色で
朝も夜も走り続け
見つけ出した青い光
好きなものと向き合うこと
今だって怖いことだけど
もう今はあの日の透明な僕じゃない
嗚呼 ありのままの

To the Bone,,Pamungkas,,"[Verse 1]
Have I ever told you
I want you to the bone
Have I ever called you
When you are all alone
And if I ever forget
To tell you how I feel
Listen to me now, babe
I want you to the bone

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to the bone, oh oh oh oh oh
I want you to the bone, oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Maybe if you can see
What I feel through my bone
Every corner in me
There's your presence that grown
Maybe I nurture it more
By saying how it feel
But I did mean it before
I want you to the bone
I want you to
[Chorus]
Take me home, I’m fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin’
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours

[Post-Chorus]
Would that be alright?
Hey, would that be alright?
I want you to the bone
So bad I can't breathe
I want you to the bone

[Bridge]
Of all the ones that begged to stay
I'm still longing for you
Of all the ones that cried their way
I'm still waiting on you
Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn’t ever have
Maybe we choose the only love
We know we won’t accept
Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For something that is real
’Cause maybe the greatest love of all
Is who the eyes can't see, yeah
[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I’m rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, I call and
I'll take control of you, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours, oh oh
Oh yeah

Standing here by me
Giving me the greatest gift you can

Choosing you daily

I Love You So,,The Walters,,"[Verse 1]
I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers
Saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've got to get away and let you go, I've got to get over

[Chorus]
But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul

Rare,,Nas,,"Part I

[Intro]
Yo, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Niggas speak down on my name like I wasn't there for 'em (There for 'em)
Talk about back in the days, this isn't back in the days (Back in the days)
They want me back in my ways, chipped tooth and the fade (Tooth and the fade)

[Verse 1]
Uh, musically I'm on Mars
Walkin' all over the beat, puttin' my feet on the stars
I rock it like Lenny, thinkin' like Jimi the first time he seen a guitar
Standin' in front of where they shot Ahmaud and said we gotta know who we are (Know who we are)
Uh, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Wearin' rare Jordans straight from Air Jordan, this a fair warnin'
Too many young gods beef over nothin'
When you get money, you know that it's comin'
Sayin' they homies, but they ain't a hunnid
We the most hunted, uh
I got my Mets hat on to the back (Back)
Y'all already know where we goin' with the stats (Stats)
Hall of fame only, kings and queens only (Queens only)
They all be grabbin' my style but you know they can't hold me
Yeah, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Y'all still on the ground, you know I've been airborne (I've been airbone)
Studyin' Big, studyin' Nietzsche
You gotta call in a chopper to reach me
Homie, I don't need a jeweler to freeze me
Ice in my veins, I make it look easy
Mentally, I'm in Queens
More money more problems, you gotta be ready for all that it brings
Let 'em say what they say, revenge on my plate, I'm lovin' the taste
They see you shinin', emotions get hard to contain
They just not evolvin' the same (The same)
Me and HB is too rare
I'm movin' all through the snares, sound on billionaire
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm flippin' the page
I'm Prince on the stage, SLAVE on his face
You know what they say, KD the wave
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days  (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
Part II

[Verse 2]
Levels of Tarantino
Curbin' my ego, even though he know
Empty glass of Pinot, cigars and casinos
What they especially praise is the ethos
Stacks on blackjack, movin' my chips
No superstition to make me get rich
I'm with this chick, just one I brought today
In between placin' my bets, we shopped at Cartier
Rose gold I copped her a set
Runway hopped in the jet, flight attendant poppin' Moet
I said I need that Dom, off of respect
We havin' conversations, niggas show me property then
I call my nigga Ant, I told him, ""Yo, I gotta be there""
Salmon shish kebab, in a misty fog, rollin' sticky log
Big dawg affair, no kids involved
Roundtable havin' war council
Press one button, it'll change the world around you
Too rare, nothin' to see here, Cuban over my streetwear
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you just to be fair
It's okay to keep the mystique, I learned that in the street
On me, solo or deep, I'm puttin' on for the G's

Part III
[Verse 3]
(Hit-Boy)
We been doin' gangsta shit for a long time
Look inside my mind, see a gold mine
I'm my own cosign, she textin' the old line
You keep starin' at the glow, bitch, don't go blind
Braveheart energy, fuck all of the enemies
XO Hennessy, it's not on me, it's in me
I'm not here to be friendly, they ain't even contendin'
Comprende?
We've been doin' gangsta shit for a long time
Look inside my mind, see a gold mine

Just spent fifty in Dubai (What?)
I'll double that to free my guys (Free 'em)

Show you 'bout sick-made lifе (Uh)

Came to beg, but we still fried him
After all the fuckery, she still want me

Fucked up the scene with no major

I Hate Alabama,,Conner Smith,,"It's that one game every year

And I hate how they yell Roll Tide

But I hate Alabama

I drove there every weekend
The Vols weren’t home at Neyland
Girl you had this Tennessean
Seein’ ten years down the road

Then you had to go and break my heart

And I guess some things change but one thing won’t

But they won't flower like they did last spring

I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

조금 걷다가 나자빠짐

변질됐지 별일 없길

Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

Almost left behind

I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me

And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside

Without You,,高爾宣 OSN,,"I’m still the same 都好像沒有變
Nothing changed 還是討厭下雨天
還是不愛認錯
脾氣是硬了點
這我都清楚但我沒有辦法改變
我後悔高中花錢裝很吵的排氣管
想努力賺錢養妳 卻養成了壞習慣
我還想帶妳到處晃晃到處帶妳玩
'Cause me without you it feels like
情人節沒有愛人
像台相機沒有快門
像張書桌沒有檯燈
'Cause me without you it feels like

A sentence without no spaces
It be like youtube without no playlist
Or a chapter without no pages
'Cause me without you it feels just wrong

I don’t wanna live without you
I dont wanna be alone and
想念妳的每個角度
如果我們還能夠重來
Oh
You don’t know how I feel inside
So
I don’t wanna live without you
我沒有辦法

'Cause I’ve been through that
重蹈覆徹 I can’t do that
沒得負責 Oh damn too bad
I need you right now, yo, where you at?
先把我的面子放兩邊
榨乾我就像搶劫
Goddamn, I got nothing left
掉進去 No fun down here
救救我 I call my friends
訴苦 說了好幾遍
他們叫我振作點
I know man but I fuckin can’t
幫我刪了 Instagram
Your post I don’t wanna see
想到妳曾promise me
我乾掉一支Hennessy

I just wanna know, baby, why you gonna go?
我們之間太多 的我捨不得放手 yeah
失去妳就像失去我的麥克風

送妳的白色玫瑰 在純黑的環境凋零
烏鴉在樹枝上詭異的很安靜
靜靜聽 我黑色的大衣
想溫暖妳 日漸冰冷的回憶
走過的 走過的生命

我在空曠的墓地
老去後還愛妳

為妳彈奏蕭邦的夜曲

跟夜風一樣的聲音 心碎的很好聽
手在鍵盤敲很輕
我給的思念很小心
妳埋葬的地方叫幽冥
為妳彈奏蕭邦的夜曲
紀念我死去的愛情
而我為妳隱姓埋名 在月光下彈琴
對妳心跳的感應
還是如此溫熱親近
懷念妳那鮮紅的唇印

那些斷翅的蜻蜓 散落在這森林
而我的眼睛 沒有絲毫同情
失去妳 淚水混濁不清
失去妳 我連笑容都有陰影
風在長滿青苔的屋頂
嘲笑我的傷心 像一口沒有水的枯井
我用淒美的字型描繪後悔莫及的那愛情

就讓我用這幾分鐘喜歡你
現實中對的錯的不要提起
現在你是我女主角演齣戲
你可以說不 但我已經牽你飛

對 我愛你
無人認可這種愛
我悄悄帶你看 無人夜深多精彩
那載滿仁義道德的腦袋
是否都應該要帶點愛

外間很多反對我愛你的聲音
任他怎講只要與你持續熱吻
要放冷槍 要炮轟
我們就更愛
誰又不忿 Yeah-yeah
外間冰封所以我對你才著緊
彈指之間釋放我這狂熱內心
情形如夜色找到街燈
我愛你已開始變成癮
讓我的愛惹起公憤
Hoo-woah-woah
No-woah
Ooh-woah, woah-woah

對 我愛你
其餘甚麼都不愛
我懶理這世界 悠然自得漂出海
這剎那為何讓雙手插袋
用一雙手擁抱更可愛

外間很多反對我愛你的聲音
任他怎講只要與你持續熱吻
要放冷槍 要炮轟
我們就更愛
誰又不忿 Yeah-yeah
外間冰封所以我對你才著緊
彈指之間釋放我這狂熱內心
情形如夜色找到街燈
我愛你已開始變成癮
讓我的愛惹起公憤 Hoah

這一秒宇宙停頓 兩顆心在跳
迷迷糊糊沒有別人 自在逍遙
Oh-woah
談及愛 如理性出發
會被蠶食掉

外間很多反對我愛你的聲音
任他怎講只要與你持續熱吻
要放冷槍 要炮轟
我們就更愛
誰又不忿 Ha-ha
或者嘴巴不信我對你肯犧牲
眼睛可不可看看我何其認真
神如何做出這種吸引
我愛你已開始變成癮
