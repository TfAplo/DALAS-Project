We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I needed you, but I never showed

Just say you won't let go

I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

For a minute, I'll forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight

Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons

I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one

Pull me like a ripcord

Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual

An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost

I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there

My mind was aching, and we were making it

Working double-time on the seduction line

Wanted no applause, just another course

Have the pills done too much?

Snap my psyche like a twig

Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive

Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air

Guess I'm just broken and broke

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye

Had to get it wrong to know just what I like

I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

[Verse 1: RM, RM & Jung Kook, j-hope]
I wanna be a good man just for you
세상을 줬네 just for you
전부 바꿨어 just for you
Now I don't know me, who are you?
우리만의 숲 너는 없었어
내가 왔던 route 잊어버렸어
나도 내가 누구였는지도 잘 모르게 됐어
거울에다 지껄여봐 너는 대체 누구니
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
널 위해서라면 난
슬퍼도 기쁜 척 할 수가 있었어
널 위해서라면 난
아파도 강한 척 할 수가 있었어

피울 수 없는 꽃을 키웠어

[Chorus: Jung Kook, V]
Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it's so mad, love it's so mad
날 지워 너의 인형이 되려 해
Love you so bad, love you so bad

Why you sad? I don't know 난 몰라
웃어봐 사랑해 말해봐
나를 봐 나조차도 버린 나
너조차 이해할 수 없는 나
낯설다 하네
니가 좋아하던 나로 변한 내가
아니라 하네
예전에 니가 잘 알고 있던 내가
아니긴 뭐가 아냐 난 눈 멀었어
사랑은 뭐가 사랑 it's all fake love

We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When there ain't a crack in the foundation

Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me

But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh

And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

To get away from your parents

I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

Maluma, baby

Apenas sale el sol y tú te vas corriendo
Sé que pensarás que esto me está doliendo
Yo no estoy pensando en lo que estás haciendo
Si somos ajenos y así nos queremos (mm-mm-mm)

Si conmigo te quedas, o con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo porque sé que volverás
Si conmigo te quedas, o con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo porque sé que volverás

Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz, felices los 4

Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz, felices los 4

Y lo hacemo' otro rato
Lo nuestro no depende de un pacto
Disfruta y sólo siente el impacto
El boom boom que te quema, ese cuerpo de sirena
Tranquila que no creo en contratos (y tú menos...)

[Refrán]
Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí, y felices los 4
No importa el qué dirán, nos gusta así

Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí, y felices los 4
No importa el qué dirán, somos tal para cual

Could never cause me pain

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free

And a million miles

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

Are running out of time

His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher

We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew, hideaway

Uno, dos, tres

[Verse 1]
It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

[Pre-Chorus]
La, la, la, whatever

La, la, la, oh, well

We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

Woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it
Not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis, huh

You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long

Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy, or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time

Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream

The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I-I-I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober

Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight

I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"", she say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on somethin' tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in

And see the world hanging upside down

{Inaudible Chatter}

[Verse 1]
Ohh!
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
[Chorus]
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Verse 2]
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'

And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out

We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
[Bridge 1]
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again

[Bridge 2]
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'

Tough to put the brakes on

Hell, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Finding out why shouldn't take this long
Easier said than done, I guess
I'm a little bit harder to love than the rest
Why does this have to be so hard?
Doing my best to hold your heart
And I, I'll never let it go again

So why are you always angry?
Why are you always quiet?
Why do you sleep alone
When I know you don't like it?
Maybe you might be different
Will it kill you to tell me the truth?

Have to do, to be loved by you?

Well I've been running as fast as I can
And you'll never get over what you can't understand
Pissed off, hanging up the telephone

Last time you ever gonna find me gone
And I, I'll never let you go again

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence
[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence",en,5.818307692307692,0.6022884615384615,0.393534617583591,0.3111161797294077,0.0847448519429523,0.5559195717796683

Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue, and Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to
[Chorus]
Just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby (Just a Holy Fool, woah-oh-oh-oh)
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Why? (
Got that?

Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (
Louder

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost, but now I am found
I can see that, once, I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey (

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why

It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud

Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spin for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' a lot of cappin', watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of thе witness

Yeah, Kutthroat Businezz, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get out, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm on probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen none yet, I promise

Have it all, rip our memories off the wall
All the special things I bought
They mean nothin' to me anymore
But to you, they were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care

Show you how little I care
How littlе I care, how little I care

Your world's an ideal

I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend

I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""

I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming

But no one makes me feel like you do

Break out the tinsel, unpack the lights
We're 'bout to bring on the merry and bright
I hear those jingle bells in the air
Ringing out the sound of joy everywhere

'Tis the season we've been waiting for
(Waiting, don't keep me waiting)
Can't you feel it knocking at your door?
(Knock, knock, it's knocking at your door)

Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year
[Verse 2]
Stockings on chimneys, angels on trees
Sugar and cinnamon, it's the little things
Blankets and movies in black and white
Together they make up this colorful life

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick

Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'm gonna pull up and spray that
Livin' like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like yo mama with the switch ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bro taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga
[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

(Cook that shit up, Quay)

[Verse 1]
My mama been told me don't give no poor performance
And whatever you gon' do, just do it
Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contacts full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that Mexican, tryna figure out what my cousin doin'
Prison with the 'migos, found out they was sellin' bricks
Wish I would've knew that shit, I would've been lit
Swear to God, since I was seventeen, I been hood rich
I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York, I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wan' show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lam' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up, but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm buyin' that red Richard Mille
Stay out my lil' brother business, just know that they gettin' millions
[Chorus]

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers

Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care

Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair

And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be

But, fuck it 'cause I ain't been broke in a minute
And your bitch hit me up said she just wanna fuck
'Cause she ain't feel the strokes in a minute
You know me, I be hittin' it different
So you can't get it back when I'm finished
So you can't get it—
When l'm cookin,' l'm not in the kitchen
I'm probably somewhere outta town doing business
So, I'm sorry if I couldn't kick it
I got attached, so I had to go missin'
Said she love me that's part of my mission
Niggas be fake, gotta keep 'em a distance
Baby stop all that trippin', you should just listen
Three words, my body different

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (Ayy)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and—

I don't wanna die young that might make mama crazy
No ocean I'm too wavy
No therapy could save me
Took L's been winnin' lately
Locked in ain't no escapin'
Sometimes I get impatient
Mask on, no face no, cases, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fall back, baby I gotta breathe
Fear nobody, I'm ready to bleed
And she for the streets, she not for me
From a place where they never believe
In the hood, thought I never would leave
Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knock as he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive
You seen what I seen then you'd probably agree
Cops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief
And mama told me not to play in these streets
It's too late 'cause l'm playin' for keeps

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (I don't wanna die young)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die, I don't-I don't wanna die young and—

Starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Finally
I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave
With every piece of you
Don't underestimate
The things that I will do
There's a fire
Starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark
The scars of your love
Remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love
They leave me breathless

We could have had it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep, (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have
No story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And it's gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Makin'
A home down there as mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love
Remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love
They leave me breathless

Rolling in the deep, (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it

With a beating

Throw your soul through every open door

Count your blessings to find what you look for

Turn my sorrow
Into treasured gold

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you

I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever gettin' older

We ain't ever gettin' older
We ain't ever gettin' older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe
[Verse 2]
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
[Verse 3]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man undercover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

[Bridge]
Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return
(I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone)
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special
I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

And realize there's nowhere left to run

And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)

You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

[Verse 2]
Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive
[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

[Verse 3]
Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

And let it shine
Just own the night

You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go

Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
